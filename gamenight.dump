332290	Stardew Valley: The Board Game	A cooperative board game of farming and friendship based on the Stardew Valley video game by Eric Barone. Work together with your fellow farmers to save the Valley from the nefarious JojaMart Corporation! To do this, you'll need to farm, fish, friend and find all kinds of different resources to fulfill your Grandpa's Goals and restore the Community Center. Collect all kinds of items, raise animals, and explore the Mine. Gain powerful upgrades and skills and as the seasons pass see if you're able to protect the magic of Stardew Valley!&#10;&#10;The goal of the game is to complete Grandpa's Goals and restore the Community Center, which requires you to gather different types of resources represented by tiles. You have a fixed amount of turns to accomplish this. This is driven by the Season Deck of 20 cards, one of which is drawn each turn to trigger certain events. Cooperatively the players decide each turn where they will focus their individual actions and place their pawn in that part of the Valley. Using their actions, they visit specific locations, trying to gather resources to complete their collective goals. Actions include things like: watering crops, trying to catch fish, rolling dice to explore the mines, and many more. When the Season Deck is exhausted, the game ends.&#10;&#10;	1	4	45	200	13	\N	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/X1oNtZV5H5BxtxlsTGIsHA__original/img/xkYA7A3vJLA2wqkaRorXcHgjQDk=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic6037615.png	\N	\N	2021	'20':146B 'abl':92B 'accomplish':136B 'action':171B,184B,198B 'amount':132B 'anim':73B 'baron':23B 'base':14B 'board':4A,8B 'card':147B 'catch':206B 'center':66B,115B 'certain':157B 'collect':67B,196B 'communiti':65B,114B 'complet':107B,194B 'cooper':7B,159B 'corpor':38B 'crop':203B 'decid':162B 'deck':144B,220B 'dice':209B 'differ':54B,121B 'drawn':152B 'driven':140B 'end':225B 'eric':22B 'event':158B 'exhaust':222B 'explor':75B,211B 'farm':11B,46B 'farmer':29B 'fellow':28B 'find':50B 'fish':47B,207B 'fix':131B 'focus':168B 'friend':48B 'friendship':13B 'fulfil':57B 'gain':78B 'game':5A,9B,20B,104B,224B 'gather':120B,191B 'goal':61B,101B,110B,197B 'grandpa':59B,108B 'includ':199B 'individu':170B 'item':71B 'jojamart':37B 'kind':52B,69B 'like':201B 'll':43B 'locat':188B 'magic':96B 'mani':215B 'mine':77B,213B 'need':44B 'nefari':36B 'one':148B 'part':178B 'pass':87B 'pawn':175B 'place':173B 'player':161B 'power':79B 'protect':94B 'rais':72B 're':91B 'repres':125B 'requir':117B 'resourc':55B,124B,192B 'restor':63B,112B 'roll':208B 'save':31B 'season':86B,143B,219B 'see':88B 'skill':82B 'specif':187B 'stardew':1A,17B,98B 'thing':200B 'tile':127B 'togeth':25B 'tri':189B,204B 'trigger':156B 'turn':134B,154B,164B 'type':122B 'upgrad':80B 'use':182B 'valley':2A,18B,33B,99B,181B 'video':19B 'visit':186B 'water':202B 'work':24B
260605	Camel Up (Second Edition)	In Camel Up, up to eight players bet on five racing camels, trying to suss out which ones will place first and second in a quick race around a pyramid. The earlier you place your bet, the more you can win &mdash; should you guess correctly, of course. Camels don't run neatly, however, sometimes landing on top of another one and being carried toward the finish line. Who's going to run when? That all depends on how the dice come out of the pyramid dice shaker, which releases one die at a time when players pause from their bets long enough to see who's actually moving!&#10;&#10;This 2018 edition of Camel Up features new artwork, a new game board design, a new pyramid design, engraved dice, and new game modes, including crazy rogue camels that start the race running in the opposite direction! You never know how a race will end!&#10;&#10;	3	8	30	45	8	\N	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/pRZrHJNoPQ3gay9EkpuZLw__original/img/VHOeHhfYK3n-wYSP0G9RT26U0uQ=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic4304741.jpg	\N	\N	2018	'2018':114B 'actual':111B 'anoth':63B 'around':32B 'artwork':121B 'bet':12B,40B,104B 'board':125B 'camel':1A,6B,16B,52B,117B,140B 'carri':67B 'come':85B 'correct':49B 'cours':51B 'crazi':138B 'depend':80B 'design':126B,130B 'dice':84B,90B,132B 'die':95B 'direct':149B 'earlier':36B 'edit':4A,115B 'eight':10B 'end':157B 'engrav':131B 'enough':106B 'featur':119B 'finish':70B 'first':25B 'five':14B 'game':124B,135B 'go':74B 'guess':48B 'howev':57B 'includ':137B 'know':152B 'land':59B 'line':71B 'long':105B 'mode':136B 'move':112B 'neat':56B 'never':151B 'new':120B,123B,128B,134B 'one':22B,64B,94B 'opposit':148B 'paus':101B 'place':24B,38B 'player':11B,100B 'pyramid':34B,89B,129B 'quick':30B 'race':15B,31B,144B,155B 'releas':93B 'rogu':139B 'run':55B,76B,145B 'second':3A,27B 'see':108B 'shaker':91B 'sometim':58B 'start':142B 'suss':19B 'time':98B 'top':61B 'toward':68B 'tri':17B 'win':45B
350933	The Guild of Merchant Explorers	In The Guild of Merchant Explorers, each player starts with one city on their personal map board.&#10;&#10;Shuffle the deck of terrain cards, then reveal most of these cards one by one. Based on the terrain revealed, each player places on their board cubes that are connected to their starting city or other cubes. You want to complete areas on your board, cross the seas to new land, and establish new cities on the board. You can explore capsized ships for treasure &mdash; which gives you special placement capabilities &mdash; and create linked connections between locations to score bonus points. Common objectives can be completed by all players, with those who complete it first scoring more points.&#10;&#10;At the end of a round, all cubes are removed from each board, leaving only the cities behind, so if you don't establish new cities, you'll be stuck in the same places.&#10;&#10;The Guild of Merchant Explorers contains multiple copies of four different maps, and the game is designed so that you can play remotely with one or more copies.&#10;&#10;	1	4	45	45	14	\N	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/HZQAedsq10yAgotyNth4og__original/img/jTvjgU0WrhyTKWf0bDyMrhPqsdM=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic6670587.jpg	\N	\N	2022	'area':64B 'base':38B 'behind':138B 'board':22B,48B,67B,80B,133B 'bonus':102B 'capabl':93B 'capsiz':84B 'card':28B,34B 'citi':17B,56B,77B,137B,146B 'common':104B 'complet':63B,108B,115B 'connect':52B,97B 'contain':160B 'copi':162B,182B 'creat':95B 'cross':68B 'cube':49B,59B,128B 'deck':25B 'design':171B 'differ':165B 'end':123B 'establish':75B,144B 'explor':5A,11B,83B,159B 'first':117B 'four':164B 'game':169B 'give':89B 'guild':2A,8B,156B 'land':73B 'leav':134B 'link':96B 'll':148B 'locat':99B 'map':21B,166B 'merchant':4A,10B,158B 'multipl':161B 'new':72B,76B,145B 'object':105B 'one':16B,35B,37B,179B 'person':20B 'place':45B,154B 'placement':92B 'play':176B 'player':13B,44B,111B 'point':103B,120B 'remot':177B 'remov':130B 'reveal':30B,42B 'round':126B 'score':101B,118B 'sea':70B 'ship':85B 'shuffl':23B 'special':91B 'start':14B,55B 'stuck':150B 'terrain':27B,41B 'treasur':87B 'want':61B
201808	Clank!: A Deck-Building Adventure	Burgle your way to adventure in the deck-building board game Clank! Sneak into an angry dragon's mountain lair to steal precious artifacts. Delve deeper to find more valuable loot. Acquire cards for your deck and watch your thievish abilities grow.&#10;&#10;Be quick and be quiet. One false step and CLANK! Each careless sound draws the attention of the dragon, and each artifact stolen increases its rage. You can enjoy your plunder only if you make it out of the depths alive!&#10;&#10;Clank! is a deck-building game. Each player has their own deck, and building yours up is part of playing the game. You start each of your turns with five cards in your hand, and you'll play them all in any order you choose. Most cards will generate resources, of which there are three different kinds:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Skill, which is used to acquire new cards for your deck.&#10;    Swords, which are used to fight the monsters that infest the dungeon.&#10;    Boots, which are used to move around the board.&#10;&#10;&#10;Every time you acquire a new card, you put it face up in your discard pile. Whenever you need to draw a card and find your deck empty, you shuffle your discard pile and turn it face down to form a new deck. With each shuffle, your newest cards become part of a bigger and better deck! Each player starts with the same cards in their deck, but they&rsquo;ll acquire different cards during their turns. Because cards can do many different things, each player&rsquo;s deck (and strategy) will become more and more different as the game unfolds.&#10;&#10;During the game, you have two goals:&#10;&#10;    Retrieve an Artifact token and escape the dragon by returning to the place you started, outside of the dungeon.&#10;    Accumulate enough points with your Artifact and other loot to beat out your opponents and earn the title of Greatest Thief in the Realm!&#10;&#10;&#10;	2	4	30	60	12	\N	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/DPjV1iI0ygo5Bl3XLNRiIg__original/img/cXqOdM3BLyIeRt0GP3M3V--gF1M=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic4449526.jpg	\N	\N	2016	'abil':48B 'accumul':306B 'acquir':39B,154B,184B,251B 'adventur':6A,11B 'aliv':90B 'angri':23B 'around':178B 'artifact':31B,71B,289B,311B 'attent':65B 'beat':316B 'becom':230B,271B 'better':236B 'bigger':234B 'board':17B,180B 'boot':172B 'build':5A,16B,96B,105B 'burgl':7B 'card':40B,122B,138B,156B,187B,203B,229B,244B,253B,258B 'careless':61B 'choos':136B 'clank':1A,19B,59B,91B 'deck':4A,15B,43B,95B,103B,159B,207B,223B,237B,247B,267B 'deck-build':3A,14B,94B 'deeper':33B 'delv':32B 'depth':89B 'differ':147B,252B,262B,275B 'discard':195B,212B 'dragon':24B,68B,294B 'draw':63B,201B 'dungeon':171B,305B 'earn':321B 'empti':208B 'enjoy':78B 'enough':307B 'escap':292B 'everi':181B 'face':191B,217B 'fals':56B 'fight':165B 'find':35B,205B 'five':121B 'form':220B 'game':18B,97B,113B,278B,282B 'generat':140B 'goal':286B 'greatest':325B 'grow':49B 'hand':125B 'increas':73B 'infest':169B 'kind':148B 'lair':27B 'll':128B,250B 'loot':38B,314B 'make':84B 'mani':261B 'monster':167B 'mountain':26B 'move':177B 'need':199B 'new':155B,186B,222B 'newest':228B 'one':55B 'oppon':319B 'order':134B 'outsid':302B 'part':109B,231B 'pile':196B,213B 'place':299B 'play':111B,129B 'player':99B,239B,265B 'plunder':80B 'point':308B 'precious':30B 'put':189B 'quick':51B 'quiet':54B 'rage':75B 'realm':329B 'resourc':141B 'retriev':287B 'return':296B 'shuffl':210B,226B 'skill':149B 'sneak':20B 'sound':62B 'start':115B,240B,301B 'steal':29B 'step':57B 'stolen':72B 'strategi':269B 'sword':160B 'thief':326B 'thievish':47B 'thing':263B 'three':146B 'time':182B 'titl':323B 'token':290B 'turn':119B,215B,256B 'two':285B 'unfold':279B 'use':152B,163B,175B 'valuabl':37B 'watch':45B 'way':9B 'whenev':197B

Towers are necessary in order to create a path between your base and a tower, or from one tower to another &mdash; but if you haven't yet connected a tower to your path, your opponents can take it if they have cards to make a larger tower.&#10;&#10;To make a path, a player must play cards that match the colors of each space in the path.

27627	Talisman: Revised 4th Edition	Theme:&#10;&#10;Talisman is an adventure board game set in a high fantasy medieval world.  Players have 14 characters to choose from all based on role playing archetypes, such as heroes, wizards, villains, thieves, monsters, etc.  The game makes players feel they are traveling the world to find equipment, weapons, ancient relics, and companions that will help them on their quest to acquire the Crown of Command.  Along the way they visit various locales in the worlds, battle each other and fantastic creatures to make their way to the top.&#10;&#10;Goal:&#10;&#10;Each player is trying to move from the outer world and ultimately to the inner world. Players wander the outer, middle, and inner worlds trying to acquire equipment, weapons, and companions.  They will also improve statistics with equipment, companions, and encounters and battles with fantasy creatures and each other.  Once they complete a Talisman quest, players will enter the inner world and face its challenges to finally reach the Portal of Power to claim the Crown of Command.  Then the other players must race to stop this player before he eventually kills them all with the Command spell.&#10;&#10;Gameplay:&#10;&#10;To begin, players select a character card from among the 14 provided.  Characters have basic statistics to start.  These are Life [hit points], Strength [physical prowess], and Craft [Magic and Intelligence].  Some characters are naturally more gifted in combat and others in magic, while others are mix of the two.  Additionally characters are often differentiated with unique abilities, starting equipment, and starting spells.  This all makes the players actually feel different during play.  In addition items and companions players acquire during play also add to statistics, increasing Strength, Craft, Life or adding new abilities, etc.&#10;&#10;Actual game play is relatively simple, making the game easy to pick up with novices.  On a player's turn they throw a die for movement.  Player then chooses which direction, left or right, or if meeting qualifications may be able to move from outer to middle world, or middle to inner world.  Once on space, player follows instructions on space, or encounters face up cards already in space, or other player if in space.  Most spaces have a player draw a number of cards to encounter.  These can be creatures, companions, weapons, equipment, treasure, or relics.  Players must fight creatures and win before acquiring any other items or companions.  If another player is in the space, players may attack with either Craft or Strength but are not required to do so.  The defender defends with same statistic attacked with.  If the defender loses, he loses a life and an item or companion of attackers choice.  If the attacker loses, he loses a life.&#10;&#10;Players start in the outer world, and build up their character's statistics and items to try and move to the middle world.  There are two ways to move up to the middle world, one requiring a test of strength and the other a boat man's ride for a price.  Once in the middle world, play proceeds in the same manner, but the challenge generally is increased with more threats such as the desert and temple.  However, there is more potential for encounters and items as most spaces now draw more than one card.&#10;&#10;In the middle world, players may also acquire a Talisman quest, that once completed, will grant them a Talisman.  The Talisman is required to unlock the Crown of Command and pass through the Portal of Power in the Inner World.&#10;&#10;Once players have a Talisman and have enough Strength or Craft to enter the Portal of Power, they will try to enter the Inner World.  There they must face and survive the guardians there, like the Vampire's Tower and Werewolf before claiming the Crown of Command.  Once a player claims the Crown of Command, they can cast the Command Spell, automatically forcing a player to lose a life.  It then becomes a race for the Crown as the other players try to take the player with the Crown down before he finishes them all off.&#10;&#10;Revised using:&#10;&#10;    Talisman: Upgrade Pack&#10;&#10;&#10;	2	6	90	90	13	\N	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/PxQnAcYv74J-dJW_s6CHMA__original/img/o0A1Lkuaqo1zBuMpGk6hsXb5dUY=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic332870.jpg	\N	\N	2007	'14':21B,204B '4th':3A 'abil':251B,287B 'abl':329B 'acquir':66B,121B,273B,393B,555B 'actual':262B,289B 'ad':285B 'add':277B 'addit':244B,268B 'adventur':9B 'along':71B 'alreadi':355B 'also':128B,276B,554B 'among':202B 'ancient':54B 'anoth':400B 'archetyp':31B 'attack':408B,427B,443B,447B 'automat':649B 'base':27B 'basic':208B 'battl':81B,137B 'becom':659B 'begin':195B 'board':10B 'boat':497B 'build':460B 'card':200B,354B,373B,547B 'cast':645B 'challeng':159B,517B 'charact':22B,199B,206B,226B,245B,463B 'choic':444B 'choos':24B,317B 'claim':168B,630B,638B 'combat':232B 'command':70B,172B,191B,576B,634B,642B,647B 'companion':57B,125B,133B,271B,380B,398B,441B 'complet':146B,561B 'craft':221B,282B,411B,598B 'creatur':86B,140B,379B,389B 'crown':68B,170B,574B,632B,640B,664B,676B 'defend':422B,423B,431B 'desert':527B 'die':312B 'differ':264B 'differenti':248B 'direct':319B 'draw':369B,543B 'easi':298B 'edit':4A 'either':410B 'encount':135B,351B,375B,536B 'enough':595B 'enter':152B,600B,609B 'equip':52B,122B,132B,253B,382B 'etc':39B,288B 'eventu':185B 'face':157B,352B,616B 'fantasi':16B,139B 'fantast':85B 'feel':44B,263B 'fight':388B 'final':161B 'find':51B 'finish':680B 'follow':346B 'forc':650B 'game':11B,41B,290B,297B 'gameplay':193B 'general':518B 'gift':230B 'goal':94B 'grant':563B 'guardian':620B 'help':60B 'hero':34B 'high':15B 'hit':215B 'howev':530B 'improv':129B 'increas':280B,520B 'inner':109B,117B,154B,340B,586B,611B 'instruct':347B 'intellig':224B 'item':269B,396B,439B,467B,538B 'kill':186B 'left':320B 'life':214B,283B,436B,452B,656B 'like':622B 'local':77B 'lose':432B,434B,448B,450B,654B 'magic':222B,236B 'make':42B,88B,259B,295B 'man':498B 'manner':514B 'may':327B,407B,553B 'mediev':17B 'meet':325B 'middl':115B,335B,338B,474B,485B,507B,550B 'mix':240B 'monster':38B 'move':100B,331B,471B,481B 'movement':314B 'must':177B,387B,615B 'natur':228B 'new':286B 'novic':303B 'number':371B 'often':247B 'one':487B,546B 'other':234B,238B 'outer':103B,114B,333B,457B 'pack':688B 'pass':578B 'physic':218B 'pick':300B 'play':30B,266B,275B,291B,509B 'player':19B,43B,96B,111B,150B,176B,182B,196B,261B,272B,306B,315B,345B,360B,368B,386B,401B,406B,453B,552B,589B,637B,652B,668B,673B 'point':216B 'portal':164B,581B,602B 'potenti':534B 'power':166B,583B,604B 'price':503B 'proceed':510B 'provid':205B 'prowess':219B 'qualif':326B 'quest':64B,149B,558B 'race':178B,661B 'reach':162B 'relat':293B 'relic':55B,385B 'requir':417B,488B,570B 'revis':2A,684B 'ride':500B 'right':322B 'role':29B 'select':197B 'set':12B 'simpl':294B 'space':344B,349B,357B,363B,365B,405B,541B 'spell':192B,256B,648B 'start':211B,252B,255B,454B 'statist':130B,209B,279B,426B,465B 'stop':180B 'strength':217B,281B,413B,492B,596B 'surviv':618B 'take':671B 'talisman':1A,6B,148B,557B,566B,568B,592B,686B 'templ':529B 'test':490B 'theme':5B 'thiev':37B 'threat':523B 'throw':310B 'top':93B 'tower':626B 'travel':47B 'treasur':383B 'tri':98B,119B,469B,607B,669B 'turn':308B 'two':243B,478B 'ultim':106B 'uniqu':250B 'unlock':572B 'upgrad':687B 'use':685B 'vampir':624B 'various':76B 'villain':36B 'visit':75B 'wander':112B 'way':73B,90B,479B 'weapon':53B,123B,381B 'werewolf':628B 'win':391B 'wizard':35B 'world':18B,49B,80B,104B,110B,118B,155B,336B,341B,458B,475B,486B,508B,551B,587B,612B
146021	Eldritch Horror	Across the globe, ancient evil is stirring. Now, you and your trusted circle of colleagues must travel around the world, working against all odds to hold back the approaching horror. Foul monsters, brutal encounters, and obscure mysteries will take you to your limit and beyond. All the while, you and your fellow investigators must unravel the otherworldy mysteries scattered around the globe in order to push back the gathering mayhem that threatens to overwhelm humanity. The end draws near! Do you have the courage to prevent global destruction?&#10;&#10;Eldritch Horror is a co-operative game of terror and adventure in which one to eight players take the roles of globetrotting investigators working to solve mysteries, gather clues, and protect the world from an Ancient One &ndash; that is, an elder being intent on destroying our world. Each Ancient One comes with its own unique decks of Mystery and Research cards, which draw you deeper into the lore surrounding each loathsome creature. Discover the true name of Azathoth or battle Cthulhu on the high seas.&#10;&#10;While the tasks on these Mystery cards (along with the locations of otherworldly gates, menacing monsters, and helpful clues) will often inform both your travel plans and the dangers you confront, you can find adventure anywhere in the world...even where you least expect it. It is during the Encounter Phase of each turn that players resolve combat or, alternatively, build their investigators' personal stories by reading an encounter narrative from one of several types of Encounter cards. You might go head to head with a monster in Istanbul or find yourself in a tough spot with the crime syndicate in a major city. Maybe you will embark on an expedition to the Pyramids or research a clue you uncover in the unnamed wilderness. You may even find your way through a gate and explore a dimension beyond time and space.&#10;&#10;Should you fail an encounter, the cost is steep. If you are fortunate, you will merely incur physical or mental trauma. However, you might also be compelled to take a Condition card, which represents a specific injury or restriction gained throughout your journey, such as a Leg Injury or Amnesia. You could find yourself getting in over your head to acquire assets and receive a Debt condition &ndash; or maybe you'll owe a favor to something far more insidious than a debt collector, and enter into a Dark Pact! Whatever your condition, you would be wise to find a resolution with haste; many conditions have a &quot;reckoning effect&quot; which, if triggered, ensure a much more sinister fate.&#10;&#10;All the while, the arrival of the Ancient One approaches. Its malign influence is manifested in Eldritch Horror as you draw Mythos Cards, which govern the appearance of otherworldly gates, fearsome monsters, and other ominous elements. Mythos cards keep your investigators under pressure, introducing new threats, even as the arrival of the Great Old One draws nearer! Since the investigators draw a new Mythos card each round, they're certain to have their hands full battling foul creatures and following up on strange rumors, even as they work to solve their three all-important mysteries.&#10;&#10;With twelve unique investigators, two hundred-fifty tokens, and over three hundred cards, Eldritch Horror presents an epic, world-spanning adventure with each and every game.&#10;&#10;	1	8	120	240	14	\N	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/oxdsZKIX5_3ovDo38EIaeg__original/img/vxK08kQAEn5qPbejK2CUTyWOsig=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1872452.jpg	\N	\N	2013	'acquir':378B 'across':3B 'adventur':102B,211B,553B 'all-import':527B 'along':184B 'also':342B 'altern':236B 'amnesia':367B 'ancient':6B,127B,140B,442B 'anywher':212B 'appear':461B 'approach':31B,444B 'around':20B,62B 'arriv':439B,484B 'asset':379B 'azathoth':169B 'back':29B,69B 'battl':171B,510B 'beyond':47B,314B 'brutal':35B 'build':237B 'card':152B,183B,254B,349B,457B,472B,499B,544B 'certain':504B 'circl':15B 'citi':280B 'clue':120B,195B,294B 'co':96B 'co-op':95B 'colleagu':17B 'collector':400B 'combat':234B 'come':142B 'compel':344B 'condit':348B,384B,409B,421B 'confront':207B 'cost':324B 'could':369B 'courag':86B 'creatur':163B,512B 'crime':275B 'cthulhu':172B 'danger':205B 'dark':405B 'debt':383B,399B 'deck':147B 'deeper':156B 'destroy':136B 'destruct':90B 'dimens':313B 'discov':164B 'draw':80B,154B,455B,490B,495B 'effect':425B 'eight':107B 'elder':132B 'eldritch':1A,91B,451B,545B 'element':470B 'embark':284B 'encount':36B,226B,245B,253B,322B 'end':79B 'ensur':429B 'enter':402B 'epic':549B 'even':216B,303B,481B,519B 'everi':557B 'evil':7B 'expect':220B 'expedit':287B 'explor':311B 'fail':320B 'far':394B 'fate':434B 'favor':391B 'fearsom':465B 'fellow':54B 'fifti':538B 'find':210B,267B,304B,370B,415B 'follow':514B 'fortun':330B 'foul':33B,511B 'full':509B 'gain':357B 'game':98B,558B 'gate':190B,309B,464B 'gather':71B,119B 'get':372B 'global':89B 'globe':5B,64B 'globetrot':113B 'go':257B 'govern':459B 'great':487B 'hand':508B 'hast':419B 'head':258B,260B,376B 'help':194B 'high':175B 'hold':28B 'horror':2A,32B,92B,452B,546B 'howev':339B 'human':77B 'hundr':537B,543B 'hundred-fifti':536B 'import':529B 'incur':334B 'influenc':447B 'inform':198B 'injuri':354B,365B 'insidi':396B 'intent':134B 'introduc':478B 'investig':55B,114B,239B,475B,494B,534B 'istanbul':265B 'journey':360B 'keep':473B 'least':219B 'leg':364B 'limit':45B 'll':388B 'loathsom':162B 'locat':187B 'lore':159B 'major':279B 'malign':446B 'mani':420B 'manifest':449B 'may':302B 'mayb':281B,386B 'mayhem':72B 'menac':191B 'mental':337B 'mere':333B 'might':256B,341B 'monster':34B,192B,263B,466B 'much':431B 'must':18B,56B 'mysteri':39B,60B,118B,149B,182B,530B 'mytho':456B,471B,498B 'name':167B 'narrat':246B 'near':81B 'nearer':491B 'new':479B,497B 'obscur':38B 'odd':26B 'often':197B 'old':488B 'omin':469B 'one':105B,128B,141B,248B,443B,489B 'oper':97B 'order':66B 'otherworld':189B,463B 'otherworldi':59B 'overwhelm':76B 'owe':389B 'pact':406B 'person':240B 'phase':227B 'physic':335B 'plan':202B 'player':108B,232B 'present':547B 'pressur':477B 'prevent':88B 'protect':122B 'push':68B 'pyramid':290B 're':503B 'read':243B 'receiv':381B 'reckon':424B 'repres':351B 'research':151B,292B 'resolut':417B 'resolv':233B 'restrict':356B 'role':111B 'round':501B 'rumor':518B 'scatter':61B 'sea':176B 'sever':250B 'sinc':492B 'sinist':433B 'solv':117B,524B 'someth':393B 'space':317B 'span':552B 'specif':353B 'spot':272B 'steep':326B 'stir':9B 'stori':241B 'strang':517B 'surround':160B 'syndic':276B 'take':41B,109B,346B 'task':179B 'terror':100B 'threat':480B 'threaten':74B 'three':526B,542B 'throughout':358B 'time':315B 'token':539B 'tough':271B 'trauma':338B 'travel':19B,201B 'trigger':428B 'true':166B 'trust':14B 'turn':230B 'twelv':532B 'two':535B 'type':251B 'uncov':296B 'uniqu':146B,533B 'unnam':299B 'unravel':57B 'way':306B 'whatev':407B 'wilder':300B 'wise':413B 'work':23B,115B,522B 'world':22B,124B,138B,215B,551B 'world-span':550B 'would':411B
169786	Scythe	It is a time of unrest in 1920s Europa. The ashes from the first great war still darken the snow. The capitalistic city-state known simply as &ldquo;The Factory&rdquo;, which fueled the war with heavily armored mechs, has closed its doors, drawing the attention of several nearby countries.&#10;&#10;Scythe is an engine-building game set in an alternate-history 1920s period. It is a time of farming and war, broken hearts and rusted gears, innovation and valor. In Scythe, each player represents a character from one of five factions of Eastern Europe who are attempting to earn their fortune and claim their faction's stake in the land around the mysterious Factory. Players conquer territory, enlist new recruits, reap resources, gain villagers, build structures, and activate monstrous mechs.&#10;&#10;Each player begins the game with different resources (power, coins, combat acumen, and popularity), a different starting location, and a hidden goal. Starting positions are specially calibrated to contribute to each faction&rsquo;s uniqueness and the asymmetrical nature of the game (each faction always starts in the same place). Scythe uses a streamlined action-selection mechanism (no rounds or phases) to keep gameplay moving at a brisk pace and reduce downtime between turns. While there is plenty of direct conflict for players who seek it, there is no player elimination.&#10;&#10;Scythe gives players almost complete control over their fate. Other than each player&rsquo;s individual hidden objective card, the only elements of luck or variability are &ldquo;encounter&rdquo; cards that players will draw as they interact with the citizens of newly explored lands. Each encounter card provides the player with several options, allowing them to mitigate the luck of the draw through their selection. Combat is also driven by choices, not luck or randomness. Every part of Scythe has an aspect of engine-building to it. Players can upgrade actions to become more efficient, build structures that improve their position on the map, enlist new recruits to enhance character abilities, activate mechs to deter opponents from invading, and expand their borders to reap greater types and quantities of resources. These engine-building aspects create a sense of momentum and progress throughout the game. The order in which players improve their engine adds to the unique feel of each game, even when playing one faction multiple times.&#10;&#10;	1	5	90	115	14	\N	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/7k_nOxpO9OGIjhLq2BUZdA__original/img/HlDb9F365w0tSP8uD1vf1pfniQE=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3163924.jpg	\N	\N	2016	'1920s':9B,64B 'abil':333B 'action':187B,313B 'action-select':186B 'activ':130B,334B 'acumen':144B 'add':376B 'allow':275B 'almost':227B 'also':289B 'altern':62B 'alternate-histori':61B 'alway':176B 'armor':38B 'around':113B 'ash':12B 'aspect':303B,357B 'asymmetr':169B 'attempt':99B 'attent':46B 'becom':315B 'begin':135B 'border':344B 'brisk':200B 'broken':74B 'build':56B,127B,307B,318B,356B 'calibr':159B 'capitalist':23B 'card':241B,251B,268B 'charact':88B,332B 'choic':292B 'citi':25B 'citizen':261B 'city-st':24B 'claim':105B 'close':41B 'coin':142B 'combat':143B,287B 'complet':228B 'conflict':213B 'conquer':118B 'contribut':161B 'control':229B 'countri':50B 'creat':358B 'darken':19B 'deter':337B 'differ':139B,148B 'direct':212B 'door':43B 'downtim':204B 'draw':44B,255B,283B 'driven':290B 'earn':101B 'eastern':95B 'effici':317B 'element':244B 'elimin':223B 'encount':250B,267B 'engin':55B,306B,355B,375B 'engine-build':54B,305B,354B 'enhanc':331B 'enlist':120B,327B 'europ':96B 'europa':10B 'even':384B 'everi':297B 'expand':342B 'explor':264B 'faction':93B,107B,164B,175B,388B 'factori':31B,116B 'farm':71B 'fate':232B 'feel':380B 'first':15B 'five':92B 'fortun':103B 'fuel':33B 'gain':125B 'game':57B,137B,173B,367B,383B 'gameplay':196B 'gear':78B 'give':225B 'goal':154B 'great':16B 'greater':347B 'heart':75B 'heavili':37B 'hidden':153B,239B 'histori':63B 'improv':321B,373B 'individu':238B 'innov':79B 'interact':258B 'invad':340B 'keep':195B 'known':27B 'land':112B,265B 'locat':150B 'luck':246B,280B,294B 'map':326B 'mech':39B,132B,335B 'mechan':189B 'mitig':278B 'momentum':362B 'monstrous':131B 'move':197B 'multipl':389B 'mysteri':115B 'natur':170B 'nearbi':49B 'new':121B,328B 'newli':263B 'object':240B 'one':90B,387B 'oppon':338B 'option':274B 'order':369B 'pace':201B 'part':298B 'period':65B 'phase':193B 'place':181B 'play':386B 'player':85B,117B,134B,215B,222B,226B,236B,253B,271B,310B,372B 'plenti':210B 'popular':146B 'posit':156B,323B 'power':141B 'progress':364B 'provid':269B 'quantiti':350B 'random':296B 'reap':123B,346B 'recruit':122B,329B 'reduc':203B 'repres':86B 'resourc':124B,140B,352B 'round':191B 'rust':77B 'scyth':1A,51B,83B,182B,224B,300B 'seek':217B 'select':188B,286B 'sens':360B 'set':58B 'sever':48B,273B 'simpli':28B 'snow':21B 'special':158B 'stake':109B 'start':149B,155B,177B 'state':26B 'still':18B 'streamlin':185B 'structur':128B,319B 'territori':119B 'throughout':365B 'time':5B,69B,390B 'turn':206B 'type':348B 'uniqu':166B,379B 'unrest':7B 'upgrad':312B 'use':183B 'valor':81B 'variabl':248B 'villag':126B 'war':17B,35B,73B

9209	Ticket to Ride	With elegantly simple gameplay, Ticket to Ride can be learned in under 15 minutes. Players collect cards of various types of train cars they then use to claim railway routes in North America. The longer the routes, the more points they earn. Additional points come to those who fulfill Destination Tickets &ndash; goal cards that connect distant cities; and to the player who builds the longest continuous route.&#10;&#10;&quot;The rules are simple enough to write on a train ticket &ndash; each turn you either draw more cards, claim a route, or get additional Destination Tickets,&quot; says Ticket to Ride author, Alan R. Moon. &quot;The tension comes from being forced to balance greed &ndash; adding more cards to your hand, and fear &ndash; losing a critical route to a competitor.&quot;&#10;&#10;Ticket to Ride continues in the tradition of Days of Wonder's big format board games featuring high-quality illustrations and components including: an oversize board map of North America, 225 custom-molded train cars, 144 illustrated cards, and wooden scoring markers.&#10;&#10;Since its introduction and numerous subsequent awards, Ticket to Ride has become the BoardGameGeek epitome of a &quot;gateway game&quot; -- simple enough to be taught in a few minutes, and with enough action and tension to keep new players involved and in the game for the duration.&#10;&#10;Part of the Ticket to Ride series.&#10;&#10;	2	5	30	60	8	\N	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/ZWJg0dCdrWHxVnc0eFXK8w__original/img/LgzEsQlF3xkSEQLoorc8ntiYiIY=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic38668.jpg	\N	\N	2004	'144':166B '15':16B '225':160B 'action':204B 'ad':114B 'addit':46B,94B 'alan':102B 'america':36B,159B 'author':101B 'award':179B 'balanc':112B 'becom':184B 'big':141B 'board':143B,155B 'boardgamegeek':186B 'build':66B 'car':26B,165B 'card':20B,56B,88B,116B,168B 'citi':60B 'claim':31B,89B 'collect':19B 'come':48B,107B 'competitor':128B 'compon':151B 'connect':58B 'continu':69B,132B 'critic':124B 'custom':162B 'custom-mold':161B 'day':137B 'destin':53B,95B 'distant':59B 'draw':86B 'durat':218B 'earn':45B 'either':85B 'eleg':5B 'enough':75B,193B,203B 'epitom':187B 'fear':121B 'featur':145B 'forc':110B 'format':142B 'fulfil':52B 'game':144B,191B,215B 'gameplay':7B 'gateway':190B 'get':93B 'goal':55B 'greed':113B 'hand':119B 'high':147B 'high-qual':146B 'illustr':149B,167B 'includ':152B 'introduct':175B 'involv':211B 'keep':208B 'learn':13B 'longer':38B 'longest':68B 'lose':122B 'map':156B 'marker':172B 'minut':17B,200B 'mold':163B 'moon':104B 'new':209B 'north':35B,158B 'numer':177B 'overs':154B 'part':219B 'player':18B,64B,210B 'point':43B,47B 'qualiti':148B 'r':103B 'railway':32B 'ride':3A,10B,100B,131B,182B,224B 'rout':33B,40B,70B,91B,125B 'rule':72B 'say':97B 'score':171B 'seri':225B 'simpl':6B,74B,192B 'sinc':173B 'subsequ':178B 'taught':196B 'tension':106B,206B 'ticket':1A,8B,54B,81B,96B,98B,129B,180B,222B 'tradit':135B 'train':25B,80B,164B 'turn':83B 'type':23B 'use':29B 'various':22B 'wonder':139B 'wooden':170B 'write':77B
237182	Root	Root is a game of adventure and war in which 2 to 4 (1 to 6 with the 'Riverfolk' expansion) players battle for control of a vast wilderness. Like Vast: The Crystal Caverns, each player in Root has unique capabilities and a different victory condition. Now, with the aid of gorgeous, multi-use cards, a truly asymmetric design has never been more accessible.&#10;&#10;The nefarious Marquise de Cat has seized the great woodland, intent on harvesting its riches. Under her rule, the many creatures of the forest have banded together. This Alliance will seek to strengthen its resources and subvert the rule of Cats. In this effort, the Alliance may enlist the help of the wandering Vagabonds who are able to move through the more dangerous woodland paths. Though some may sympathize with the Alliance&rsquo;s hopes and dreams, these wanderers are old enough to remember the great birds of prey who once controlled the woods.&#10;&#10;Meanwhile, at the edge of the region, the proud, squabbling Eyrie have found a new commander who they hope will lead their faction to resume their ancient birthright. The stage is set for a contest that will decide the fate of the great woodland. It is up to the players to decide which group will ultimately take root.&#10;&#10;In Root, players drive the narrative, and the differences between each role create an unparalleled level of interaction and replayability. Leder Games invites you and your family to explore the fantastic world of Root!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;	2	4	60	90	10	\N	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/JUAUWaVUzeBgzirhZNmHHw__original/img/E0s2LvtFA1L5YKk-_44D4u2VD2s=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic4254509.jpg	\N	\N	2018	'1':15B '2':12B '4':14B '6':17B 'abl':122B 'access':65B 'adventur':7B 'aid':50B 'allianc':94B,111B,137B 'ancient':185B 'asymmetr':59B 'band':91B 'battl':23B 'bird':151B 'birthright':186B 'capabl':41B 'card':56B 'cat':70B,106B 'cavern':34B 'command':174B 'condit':46B 'contest':193B 'control':25B,156B 'creat':229B 'creatur':86B 'crystal':33B 'danger':128B 'de':69B 'decid':196B,210B 'descript':251B 'design':60B 'differ':44B,225B 'dream':141B 'drive':220B 'edg':162B 'effort':109B 'enlist':113B 'enough':146B 'expans':21B 'explor':245B 'eyri':169B 'faction':181B 'famili':243B 'fantast':247B 'fate':198B 'forest':89B 'found':171B 'game':5B,238B 'gorgeous':52B 'great':74B,150B,201B 'group':212B 'harvest':78B 'help':115B 'hope':139B,177B 'intent':76B 'interact':234B 'invit':239B 'lead':179B 'leder':237B 'level':232B 'like':30B 'mani':85B 'marquis':68B 'may':112B,133B 'meanwhil':159B 'move':124B 'multi':54B 'multi-us':53B 'narrat':222B 'nefari':67B 'never':62B 'new':173B 'old':145B 'path':130B 'player':22B,36B,208B,219B 'prey':153B 'proud':167B 'publish':254B 'region':165B 'rememb':148B 'replay':236B 'resourc':100B 'resum':183B 'rich':80B 'riverfolk':20B 'role':228B 'root':1A,2B,38B,216B,218B,250B 'rule':83B,104B 'seek':96B 'seiz':72B 'set':190B 'squabbl':168B 'stage':188B 'strengthen':98B 'subvert':102B 'sympath':134B 'take':215B 'though':131B 'togeth':92B 'truli':58B 'ultim':214B 'uniqu':40B 'unparallel':231B 'use':55B 'vagabond':119B 'vast':28B,31B 'victori':45B 'wander':118B,143B 'war':9B 'wilder':29B 'wood':158B 'woodland':75B,129B,202B 'world':248B

16992	Tsuro	From the publisher:&#10;&#10;A beautiful and beautifully simple game of laying a tile before your own token to continue its path on each turn.  The goal is to keep your token on the board longer than anyone else's, but as the board fills up this becomes harder because there are fewer empty spaces left... and another player's tile may also extend your own path in a direction you'd rather not go.  Easy to introduce to new players, Tsuro lasts a mere 15 minutes and actually does work for any number from 2 to 8.&#10;&#10;Theme:&#10;&#10;Tsuro has an Asian spiritual theme - the lines representing the &quot;many roads that lead to divine wisdom&quot;, and the game as a whole representing &quot;the classic quest for enlightenment&quot;.&#10;&#10;This theme is very light and the game essentially plays as an abstract.&#10;&#10;Gameplay:&#10;&#10;The game consists of tiles with twisting lines on them, a 6x6 grid on which to lay these tiles and a token for each player. Each player has a hand of tiles. On your turn you do two things: place a tile from your hand onto the board next to your token and move your token as far as it can go along the line it is currently on, until it is stopped by an empty space with no tile in (yet), the edge of the board or colliding with another player's token. If your token reaches the edge of the board or collides with another player's token, you are out of the game. The aim of the game is to be the last player left with a token on the board. Strategy therefore consists of trying to drive your opponents either into each other or off the board whilst extending your own route in directions that will make it difficult for your opponents to do the same.&#10;&#10;Other notes:&#10;&#10;Tsuro was originally patented by McMurchie in 1979 under the name Squiggle Game, but was apparently not published at that time.  Somewhat similar to Metro and Spaghetti Junction.&#10;&#10;	2	8	15	20	8	\N	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/2V3d4ryhxkS3RoPtDrvpUw__original/img/TP5U-O2eujPBK9IVmmifdfkWwdQ=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic875761.jpg	\N	\N	2005	'15':86B '1979':322B '2':96B '6x6':154B '8':98B 'abstract':141B 'actual':89B 'aim':260B 'along':205B 'also':63B 'anoth':58B,233B,249B 'anyon':38B 'appar':330B 'asian':103B 'beauti':6B,8B 'becom':48B 'board':35B,44B,190B,229B,245B,276B,293B 'classic':125B 'collid':231B,247B 'consist':145B,279B 'continu':20B 'current':210B 'd':72B 'difficult':305B 'direct':70B,300B 'divin':115B 'drive':283B 'easi':76B 'edg':226B,242B 'either':286B 'els':39B 'empti':54B,218B 'enlighten':128B 'essenti':137B 'extend':64B,295B 'far':200B 'fewer':53B 'fill':45B 'game':10B,119B,136B,144B,258B,263B,327B 'gameplay':142B 'go':75B,204B 'goal':27B 'grid':155B 'hand':172B,187B 'harder':49B 'introduc':78B 'junction':342B 'keep':30B 'last':83B,268B 'lay':12B,159B 'lead':113B 'left':56B,270B 'light':133B 'line':107B,150B,207B 'longer':36B 'make':303B 'mani':110B 'may':62B 'mcmurchi':320B 'mere':85B 'metro':339B 'minut':87B 'move':196B 'name':325B 'new':80B 'next':191B 'note':314B 'number':94B 'onto':188B 'oppon':285B,308B 'origin':317B 'patent':318B 'path':22B,67B 'place':182B 'play':138B 'player':59B,81B,167B,169B,234B,250B,269B 'publish':4B,332B 'quest':126B 'rather':73B 'reach':240B 'repres':108B,123B 'road':111B 'rout':298B 'similar':337B 'simpl':9B 'somewhat':336B 'space':55B,219B 'spaghetti':341B 'spiritu':104B 'squiggl':326B 'stop':215B 'strategi':277B 'theme':99B,105B,130B 'therefor':278B 'thing':181B 'tile':14B,61B,147B,161B,174B,184B,222B 'time':335B 'token':18B,32B,164B,194B,198B,236B,239B,252B,273B 'tri':281B 'tsuro':1A,82B,100B,315B 'turn':25B,177B 'twist':149B 'two':180B 'whilst':294B 'whole':122B 'wisdom':116B 'work':91B 'yet':224B

With detailed miniatures of the legendary monsters and a modular cityscape of 3D buildings to destroy, it's an epic battle every time you play!&#10;&#10;In more detail, each player has their own deck of cards unique to the kaiju they control. As you throw trains and tanks at the opponents and attack them directly to cause damage, you can burn cards out of their deck, reducing their options on future turns.

306779	SEND IT! The Mountain Biking Board Game	The board game every mountain biker needs.&#10;&#10;SEND IT! is for those times when you want to ride, but can't &mdash; maybe you're injured, maybe it's too muddy or maybe you're just tired from your latest adventure &mdash; because no matter what, even when you can't ride, you should be able to SEND IT!&#10;&#10;SEND IT! is a fast-paced mountain bike game where you ride, train, prepare and &quot;send&quot; progressively harder features as you race from the trail head to be the first to send the final feature and reach the Golden Burrito.&#10;&#10;Riders roll to train and move while drawing prepare cards to improve their chances of successfully sending the next feature, all while trying not to crash. Should you play it safe or just &quot;SEND IT!&quot;?&#10;&#10;On each turn, riders choose two actions, which can be the same or different, from the following options:&#10;1. Ride - roll the riding die and move 1-3 spaces along the singletrack.&#10;2. Train - roll the two training dice to gain the skill points you need to send the next feature.&#10;3. Prepare - draw a Prepare card to gain points (which help you recover from a crash and send the next feature) or special skills.&#10;4. SEND IT - if you are on a feature and have the necessary skills, play Prepare card points and roll the 20-sided die to try to send it and pass on to more difficult singletrack.&#10;&#10;Just like real mountain biking, crashing can happen in a variety of ways - you can crash while training, while riding or while sending it - and until you recover from your crash you can't do anything but prepare, giving the other riders the chance to get ahead.&#10;&#10;The first rider to send the final feature (the &quot;Hall of Fame&quot;) and reach the Golden Burrito wins the game.&#10;&#10;For a more advanced version, add the &quot;Trail Building&quot; action which allows riders to place the features instead of randomly placing them at the beginning of the game.&#10;&#10;-description from publisher&#10;&#10;	2	6	60	150	14	\N	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/HlVdJjfg2E-QqrADvmsiaw__original/img/qg0o-znnjWWrEH-FBscMFf8k8Cg=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic5347636.jpg	\N	\N	2020	'-3':168B '1':159B,167B '2':173B '20':237B '3':192B '4':216B 'abl':61B 'action':147B,328B 'add':324B 'advanc':322B 'adventur':47B 'ahead':298B 'allow':330B 'along':170B 'anyth':287B 'begin':343B 'bike':5A,73B,256B 'biker':13B 'board':6A,9B 'build':327B 'burrito':105B,315B 'card':115B,197B,232B 'chanc':119B,295B 'choos':145B 'crash':131B,207B,257B,267B,282B 'descript':347B 'dice':179B 'die':164B,239B 'differ':154B 'difficult':250B 'draw':113B,194B 'even':52B 'everi':11B 'fame':310B 'fast':70B 'fast-pac':69B 'featur':84B,100B,125B,191B,212B,224B,306B,335B 'final':99B,305B 'first':95B,300B 'follow':157B 'gain':181B,199B 'game':7A,10B,74B,318B,346B 'get':297B 'give':290B 'golden':104B,314B 'hall':308B 'happen':259B 'harder':83B 'head':91B 'help':202B 'improv':117B 'injur':32B 'instead':336B 'latest':46B 'like':253B 'matter':50B 'mayb':29B,33B,39B 'mountain':4A,12B,72B,255B 'move':111B,166B 'muddi':37B 'necessari':228B 'need':14B,186B 'next':124B,190B,211B 'option':158B 'pace':71B 'pass':246B 'place':333B,339B 'play':134B,230B 'point':184B,200B,233B 'prepar':79B,114B,193B,196B,231B,289B 'progress':82B 'publish':349B 'race':87B 'random':338B 're':31B,41B 'reach':102B,312B 'real':254B 'recov':204B,279B 'ride':25B,57B,77B,160B,163B,271B 'rider':106B,144B,293B,301B,331B 'roll':107B,161B,175B,235B 'safe':136B 'send':1A,15B,63B,65B,81B,97B,122B,139B,188B,209B,217B,243B,274B,303B 'side':238B 'singletrack':172B,251B 'skill':183B,215B,229B 'space':169B 'special':214B 'success':121B 'time':20B 'tire':43B 'trail':90B,326B 'train':78B,109B,174B,178B,269B 'tri':128B,241B 'turn':143B 'two':146B,177B 'varieti':262B 'version':323B 'want':23B 'way':264B 'win':316B

274637	Unmatched: Battle of Legends, Volume One	In battle, there are no equals.&#10;&#10;Unmatched is a highly asymmetrical miniature fighting game for two or four players. Each hero is represented by a unique deck designed to evoke their style and legend. Tactical movement and no-luck combat resolution create a unique play experience that rewards expertise, but just when you've mastered one set, new heroes arrive to provide all new match-ups.&#10;&#10;Battle of Legends, Volume One features four heroes. King Arthur sacrifices cards to power up his attacks and gets some timely assistance from Merlin's magic. Alice is back from Wonderland with a giant vorpal blade and the Jabberwock by her side as she grows and shrinks to gain advantages on attack and defense. Medusa is happy to attack from range and let her harpies hound you, but just one devastating glance could end the battle quickly.

2025	Frag	Frag is the essence of early first person shooters like Doom and Quake distilled into a board game.  The tagline sums up the game: &quot;If it moves, shoot it.&quot;&#10;&#10;Players create characters by assigning stat points and spawn on the game board, then roll dice to move around the board, pick up weapon and gadget cards, and shoot at opponents.  There are also cheat cards that can be used to gain an advantage on other players when they least expect it.  When players are killed they respawn on their next turn and the first player to score three kills is the winner.&#10;&#10;	2	6	30	30	10	\N	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/eOTtto9-POsUdEmsTz2XSw__original/img/RM9sjwR55R2OlgtyPcSerkDmUiQ=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic407469.jpg	\N	\N	2001	'advantag':74B 'also':64B 'around':49B 'assign':35B 'board':18B,43B,51B 'card':57B,66B 'charact':33B 'cheat':65B 'creat':32B 'dice':46B 'distil':15B 'doom':12B 'earli':7B 'essenc':5B 'expect':81B 'first':8B,95B 'frag':1A,2B 'gadget':56B 'gain':72B 'game':19B,25B,42B 'kill':86B,100B 'least':80B 'like':11B 'move':28B,48B 'next':91B 'oppon':61B 'person':9B 'pick':52B 'player':31B,77B,84B,96B 'point':37B 'quak':14B 'respawn':88B 'roll':45B 'score':98B 'shoot':29B,59B 'shooter':10B 'spawn':39B 'stat':36B 'sum':22B 'taglin':21B 'three':99B 'turn':92B 'use':70B 'weapon':54B 'winner':103B
176083	Hit Z Road	In the fast-paced and morbidly kitschy game Hit Z Road, you and your fellow players embark on a road trip going south from Chicago along America's famous Route 66 &mdash; now infested by zombies. As you travel though a deck of adventure cards rife with dangers, you battle zombie hordes, drive abandoned school buses, scavenge for gas and bullets, and explore a darkened, tainted American countryside full of shambling undead, haunted carnivals, and plumes of toxic gas. Your goal is to stay alive until you reach the safe, sandy beaches of the California coast.&#10;&#10;Three different stages of adventure cards create an experience of increasing difficulty and ensure that each playthrough is unique. Each round begins with an auction that determines both player order and which cards you will encounter. Since the resources used for bidding are the same as those used to battle the oncoming zombie hordes, your survival depends as much on your resource management as it does upon winning those bidding wars. The player who either accumulates the most points or survives the longest wins.&#10;&#10;Zombies of all types await, with cannibals, anti-personnel mines and radioactive wastes also being among the hazards awaiting the players. Who will survive the zombie onslaught?&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;	1	4	30	60	12	\N	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/dPuhviFAHX6m9eCTw0OTsA__original/img/mfDXkmkMunWR6ar33FM26H2Wf6g=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3539855.jpg	\N	\N	2016	'66':35B 'abandon':57B 'accumul':175B 'adventur':47B,104B 'aliv':88B 'along':30B 'also':198B 'america':31B 'american':70B 'among':200B 'anti':192B 'anti-personnel':191B 'auction':124B 'await':188B,203B 'battl':53B,149B 'beach':95B 'begin':121B 'bid':141B,169B 'bullet':64B 'buse':59B 'california':98B 'cannib':190B 'card':48B,105B,132B 'carniv':77B 'chicago':29B 'coast':99B 'countrysid':71B 'creat':106B 'danger':51B 'darken':68B 'deck':45B 'depend':156B 'descript':212B 'determin':126B 'differ':101B 'difficulti':111B 'drive':56B 'either':174B 'embark':21B 'encount':135B 'ensur':113B 'experi':108B 'explor':66B 'famous':33B 'fast':7B 'fast-pac':6B 'fellow':19B 'full':72B 'game':12B 'gas':62B,82B 'go':26B 'goal':84B 'haunt':76B 'hazard':202B 'hit':1A,13B 'hord':55B,153B 'increas':110B 'infest':37B 'kitschi':11B 'longest':182B 'manag':162B 'mine':194B 'morbid':10B 'much':158B 'oncom':151B 'onslaught':211B 'order':129B 'pace':8B 'personnel':193B 'player':20B,128B,172B,205B 'playthrough':116B 'plume':79B 'point':178B 'publish':215B 'radioact':196B 'reach':91B 'resourc':138B,161B 'rife':49B 'road':3A,15B,24B 'round':120B 'rout':34B 'safe':93B 'sandi':94B 'scaveng':60B 'school':58B 'shambl':74B 'sinc':136B 'south':27B 'stage':102B 'stay':87B 'surviv':155B,180B,208B 'taint':69B 'though':43B 'three':100B 'toxic':81B 'travel':42B 'trip':25B 'type':187B 'undead':75B 'uniqu':118B 'upon':166B 'use':139B,147B 'war':170B 'wast':197B 'win':167B,183B 'z':2A,14B 'zombi':39B,54B,152B,184B,210B
2932	Hnefatafl	Hnefatafl, also known as The Viking Game, The King's Table or simply Tafl, is one of those two-player games where the opposing sides are not equal in number. The defending side comprises twelve soldiers and a king, who start the game in a cross formation in the center of the board. Their objective is for the king to escape by reaching any of the four corner squares. The attackers comprise 24 soldiers positioned in four groups of 6 around the perimeter of the board. All pieces move like the Rook in chess and pieces are taken by &quot;sandwiching&quot; i.e. moving your piece so that an opponent's piece is trapped horizontally or vertically between two of yours. There is a host of information on the Internet about Hnefatafl, including many rule variations that are worth experimenting with.&#10;&#10;A copy of the game was published in issue #128 of Dragon magazine, Dec 1987 (later republished as part of a boxed set: The Best of Dragon Magazine Games in 1990).&#10;&#10;One of the oldest games in the world - traced in various versions to the Vikings, Welsh, Saxons, and Irish. The origins of this game can be traced through Petteia, played by the Romans, to the even older versions played by the Ancient Greeks and Egyptians.&#10;&#10;Derivatives of Hnefatafl include Breakthru, Break Away, Seikkailu Merell&#195;&#164;, Tablut and Thud.&#10;&#10;	2	2	20	20	7	\N	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/rIXE-wL-BnaMBQUwf_5VxQ__original/img/CRO4aGS2H-WAejGLQDdaXlYku8o=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1812568.jpg	\N	\N	400	'128':151B '1987':156B '1990':172B '24':75B '6':82B 'also':3B 'ancient':214B 'around':83B 'attack':73B 'away':224B 'best':166B 'board':55B,88B 'box':163B 'break':223B 'breakthru':222B 'center':52B 'chess':96B 'compris':36B,74B 'copi':143B 'corner':70B 'cross':48B 'dec':155B 'defend':34B 'deriv':218B 'dragon':153B,168B 'egyptian':217B 'equal':30B 'escap':63B 'even':208B 'experi':140B 'format':49B 'four':69B,79B 'game':8B,23B,45B,146B,170B,177B,196B 'greek':215B 'group':80B 'hnefatafl':1A,2B,132B,220B 'horizont':115B 'host':125B 'i.e':103B 'includ':133B,221B 'inform':127B 'internet':130B 'irish':191B 'issu':150B 'king':10B,41B,61B 'known':4B 'later':157B 'like':92B 'magazin':154B,169B 'mani':134B 'merel':226B 'move':91B,104B 'number':32B 'object':57B 'older':209B 'oldest':176B 'one':17B,173B 'oppon':110B 'oppos':26B 'origin':193B 'part':160B 'perimet':85B 'petteia':201B 'piec':90B,98B,106B,112B 'play':202B,211B 'player':22B 'posit':77B 'publish':148B 'reach':65B 'republish':158B 'roman':205B 'rook':94B 'rule':135B 'sandwich':102B 'saxon':189B 'seikkailu':225B 'set':164B 'side':27B,35B 'simpli':14B 'soldier':38B,76B 'squar':71B 'start':43B 'tabl':12B 'tablut':227B 'tafl':15B 'taken':100B 'thud':229B 'trace':181B,199B 'trap':114B 'twelv':37B 'two':21B,119B 'two-play':20B 'variat':136B 'various':183B 'version':184B,210B 'vertic':117B 'vike':7B,187B 'welsh':188B 'world':180B 'worth':139B
30549	Pandemic	In Pandemic, several virulent diseases have broken out simultaneously all over the world! The players are disease-fighting specialists whose mission is to treat disease hotspots while researching cures for each of four plagues before they get out of hand.&#10;&#10;The game board depicts several major population centers on Earth. On each turn, a player can use up to four actions to travel between cities, treat infected populaces, discover a cure, or build a research station. A deck of cards provides the players with these abilities, but sprinkled throughout this deck are Epidemic! cards that accelerate and intensify the diseases' activity. A second, separate deck of cards controls the &quot;normal&quot; spread of the infections.&#10;&#10;Taking a unique role within the team, players must plan their strategy to mesh with their specialists' strengths in order to conquer the diseases. For example, the Operations Expert can build research stations which are needed to find cures for the diseases and which allow for greater mobility between cities; the Scientist needs only four cards of a particular disease to cure it instead of the normal five&mdash;but the diseases are spreading quickly and time is running out. If one or more diseases spreads beyond recovery or if too much time elapses, the players all lose. If they cure the four diseases, they all win!&#10;&#10;The 2013 edition of Pandemic includes two new characters&mdash;the Contingency Planner and the Quarantine Specialist&mdash;not available in earlier editions of the game.&#10;&#10;Pandemic is the first game in the Pandemic series.&#10;&#10;	2	4	45	45	8	\N	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/S3ybV1LAp-8SnHIXLLjVqA__original/img/IsrvRLpUV1TEyZsO5rC-btXaPz0=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1534148.jpg	\N	\N	2008	'2013':224B 'abil':88B 'acceler':98B 'action':63B 'activ':103B 'allow':161B 'avail':240B 'beyond':202B 'board':45B 'broken':8B 'build':75B,147B 'card':82B,96B,109B,172B 'center':50B 'charact':231B 'citi':67B,166B 'conquer':138B 'conting':233B 'control':110B 'cure':31B,73B,155B,178B,216B 'deck':80B,93B,107B 'depict':46B 'discov':71B 'diseas':6B,19B,27B,102B,140B,158B,176B,187B,200B,219B 'disease-fight':18B 'earlier':242B 'earth':52B 'edit':225B,243B 'elaps':209B 'epidem':95B 'exampl':142B 'expert':145B 'fight':20B 'find':154B 'first':250B 'five':184B 'four':35B,62B,171B,218B 'game':44B,246B,251B 'get':39B 'greater':163B 'hand':42B 'hotspot':28B 'includ':228B 'infect':69B,116B 'instead':180B 'intensifi':100B 'lose':213B 'major':48B 'mesh':130B 'mission':23B 'mobil':164B 'much':207B 'must':125B 'need':152B,169B 'new':230B 'normal':112B,183B 'one':197B 'oper':144B 'order':136B 'pandem':1A,3B,227B,247B,254B 'particular':175B 'plagu':36B 'plan':126B 'planner':234B 'player':16B,57B,85B,124B,211B 'popul':49B 'populac':70B 'provid':83B 'quarantin':237B 'quick':190B 'recoveri':203B 'research':30B,77B,148B 'role':120B 'run':194B 'scientist':168B 'second':105B 'separ':106B 'seri':255B 'sever':4B,47B 'simultan':10B 'specialist':21B,133B,238B 'spread':113B,189B,201B 'sprinkl':90B 'station':78B,149B 'strategi':128B 'strength':134B 'take':117B 'team':123B 'throughout':91B 'time':192B,208B 'travel':65B 'treat':26B,68B 'turn':55B 'two':229B 'uniqu':119B 'use':59B 'virul':5B 'whose':22B 'win':222B 'within':121B 'world':14B
225694	Decrypto	Players compete in two teams in Decrypto, with each trying to correctly interpret the coded messages presented to them by their teammates while cracking the codes they intercept from the opposing team.&#10;&#10;In more detail, each team has their own screen, and in this screen they tuck four cards in pockets numbered 1-4, letting everyone on the same team see the words on these cards while hiding the words from the opposing team. In the first round, each team does the following: One team member takes a code card that shows three of the digits 1-4 in some order, e.g., 4-2-1. They then give a coded message that their teammates must use to guess this code. For example, if the team's four words are &quot;pig&quot;, &quot;candy&quot;, &quot;tent&quot;, and &quot;son&quot;, then I might say &quot;Sam-striped-pink&quot; and hope that my teammates can correctly map those words to 4-2-1. If they guess correctly, great; if not, we receive a black mark of failure.&#10;&#10;Starting in the second round, a member of each team must again give a clue about their words to match a numbered code. If I get 2-4-3, I might now say, &quot;sucker-prince-stake&quot;. The other team then attempts to guess our numbered code. If they're correct, they receive a white mark of success; if not, then my team must guess the number correctly or take a black mark of failure. (Guessing correctly does nothing except avoid failure and give the opposing team information about what our hidden words might be.)&#10;&#10;The rounds continue until a team collects either its second white mark (winning the game) or its second black mark (losing the game). Games typically last between 4-7 rounds. If neither team has won after eight rounds, then each team must attempt to guess the other team's words; whichever team guesses more words correctly wins.&#10;&#10;	3	8	15	45	12	\N	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/hHZWXnUTMYDd_KTAM6Jwlw__original/img/lL6QJ69UmZT7CeljUcjyA47b-e0=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3759421.jpg	\N	\N	2018	'-1':106B,157B '-2':105B,156B '-3':200B '-4':55B,99B,199B '-7':295B '1':54B,98B '2':198B '4':104B,155B,294B 'attempt':213B,309B 'avoid':252B 'black':168B,243B,285B 'candi':132B 'card':50B,67B,91B 'clue':186B 'code':16B,27B,90B,111B,121B,194B,218B 'collect':273B 'compet':3B 'continu':269B 'correct':13B,150B,161B,222B,239B,248B,322B 'crack':25B 'decrypto':1A,8B 'detail':36B 'digit':97B 'e.g':103B 'eight':303B 'either':274B 'everyon':57B 'exampl':123B 'except':251B 'failur':171B,246B,253B 'first':78B 'follow':84B 'four':49B,128B 'game':281B,289B,290B 'get':197B 'give':109B,184B,255B 'great':162B 'guess':119B,160B,215B,236B,247B,311B,319B 'hidden':263B 'hide':69B 'hope':145B 'inform':259B 'intercept':29B 'interpret':14B 'last':292B 'let':56B 'lose':287B 'map':151B 'mark':169B,227B,244B,278B,286B 'match':191B 'member':87B,178B 'messag':17B,112B 'might':138B,202B,265B 'must':116B,182B,235B,308B 'neither':298B 'noth':250B 'number':53B,193B,217B,238B 'one':85B 'oppos':32B,74B,257B 'order':102B 'pig':131B 'pink':143B 'player':2B 'pocket':52B 'present':18B 'princ':207B 're':221B 'receiv':166B,224B 'round':79B,176B,268B,296B,304B 'sam':141B 'sam-striped-pink':140B 'say':139B,204B 'screen':42B,46B 'second':175B,276B,284B 'see':62B 'show':93B 'son':135B 'stake':208B 'start':172B 'stripe':142B 'success':229B 'sucker':206B 'sucker-prince-stak':205B 'take':88B,241B 'team':6B,33B,38B,61B,75B,81B,86B,126B,181B,211B,234B,258B,272B,299B,307B,314B,318B 'teammat':23B,115B,148B 'tent':133B 'three':94B 'tri':11B 'tuck':48B 'two':5B 'typic':291B 'use':117B 'whichev':317B 'white':226B,277B 'win':279B,323B 'won':301B 'word':64B,71B,129B,153B,189B,264B,316B,321B
65244	Forbidden Island	Forbidden Island is a visually stunning cooperative board game. Instead of winning by competing with other players like most games, everyone must work together to win the game. Players take turns moving their pawns around the 'island', which is built by arranging the many beautifully screen-printed tiles before play begins. As the game progresses, more and more island tiles sink, becoming unavailable, and the pace increases. Players use strategies to keep the island from sinking, while trying to collect treasures and items. As the water level rises, it gets more difficult- sacrifices must be made.&#10;&#10;What causes this game to truly stand out among co-op and competitive games alike is the extreme detail that has been paid to the physical components of the game. It comes in a sturdy and organized tin of good shelf storage size. The plastic treasure pieces and wooden pawns are well crafted and they fit just right into the box. The cards are durable, well printed, and easy to understand. The island tiles are the real gem: they are screen-printed with vibrant colors, each with a unique and pleasing image.&#10;&#10;With multiple levels of difficulty, different characters to choose from (each with a special ability of their own), many optional island formats and game variations available, Forbidden Island has huge replay value. The game can be played by as few as two players and up to four (though it can accommodate five). More players translates into a faster and more difficult game, though the extra help can make all the difference. This is a fun game, tricky for players of almost any age. Selling for under twenty dollars, oddly, Forbidden Island is a rare game of both quality and affordable price.&#10; For those who enjoy Forbidden Island, a follow-up project by Gamewright titled Forbidden Desert was released in 2013.&#10;&#10;From the publisher's website:&#10;&#10;Dare to discover Forbidden Island!

13	CATAN	In CATAN (formerly The Settlers of Catan), players try to be the dominant force on the island of Catan by building settlements, cities, and roads. On each turn dice are rolled to determine what resources the island produces. Players build by spending resources (sheep, wheat, wood, brick and ore) that are depicted by these resource cards; each land type, with the exception of the unproductive desert, produces a specific resource: hills produce brick, forests produce wood, mountains produce ore, fields produce wheat, and pastures produce sheep.&#10;&#10;Set-up includes randomly placing large hexagonal tiles (each showing a resource or the desert) in a honeycomb shape and surrounding them with water tiles, some of which contain ports of exchange. Number disks, which will correspond to die rolls (two 6-sided dice are used), are placed on each resource tile. Each player is given two settlements (think: houses) and roads (sticks) which are, in turn, placed on intersections and borders of the resource tiles. Players collect a hand of resource cards based on which hex tiles their last-placed house is adjacent to. A robber pawn is placed on the desert tile.&#10;&#10;A turn consists of possibly playing a development card, rolling the dice, everyone (perhaps) collecting resource cards based on the roll and position of houses (or upgraded cities&mdash;think: hotels) unless a 7 is rolled, turning in resource cards (if possible and desired) for improvements, trading cards at a port, and trading resource cards with other players. If a 7 is rolled, the active player moves the robber to a new hex tile and steals resource cards from other players who have built structures adjacent to that tile.&#10;&#10;Points are accumulated by building settlements and cities, having the longest road and the largest army (from some of the development cards), and gathering certain development cards that simply award victory points. When a player has gathered 10 points (some of which may be held in secret), he announces his total and claims the win.&#10;&#10;CATAN has won multiple awards and is one of the most popular games in recent history due to its amazing ability to appeal to experienced gamers as well as those new to the hobby.&#10;&#10;Die Siedler von Catan was originally published by KOSMOS and has gone through multiple editions. It was licensed by Mayfair and has undergone four editions as The Settlers of Catan. In 2015, it was formally renamed CATAN to better represent itself as the core and base game of the CATAN series. It has been re-published in two travel editions, portable edition and compact edition, as a special gallery edition (replaced in 2009 with a family edition), as an anniversary wooden edition, as a deluxe 3D collector's edition, in the basic Simply Catan, as a beginner version, and with an entirely new theme in Japan and Asia as Settlers of Catan: Rockman Edition. Numerous spin-offs and expansions have also been made for the game.&#10;&#10;	3	4	60	120	10	\N	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/W3Bsga_uLP9kO91gZ7H8yw__original/img/xV7oisd3RQ8R-k18cdWAYthHXsA=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic2419375.jpg	\N	\N	1995	'10':319B '2009':444B '2015':402B '3d':457B '6':130B '7':226B,253B 'abil':357B 'accumul':284B 'activ':257B 'adjac':183B,278B 'also':493B 'amaz':356B 'anniversari':451B 'announc':330B 'appeal':359B 'armi':297B 'asia':479B 'award':311B,341B 'base':172B,211B,416B 'basic':463B 'beginn':468B 'better':409B 'border':160B 'brick':48B,74B 'build':22B,41B,286B 'built':276B 'card':57B,171B,202B,210B,232B,240B,247B,270B,303B,308B 'catan':1A,3B,8B,20B,337B,374B,400B,407B,420B,465B,483B 'certain':306B 'citi':24B,221B,289B 'claim':334B 'collect':166B,208B 'collector':458B 'compact':435B 'consist':196B 'contain':117B 'core':414B 'correspond':125B 'delux':456B 'depict':53B 'desert':67B,103B,192B 'desir':236B 'determin':34B 'develop':201B,302B,307B 'dice':30B,132B,205B 'die':127B,371B 'disk':122B 'domin':14B 'due':353B 'edit':385B,395B,431B,433B,436B,441B,448B,453B,460B,485B 'entir':473B 'everyon':206B 'except':63B 'exchang':120B 'expans':491B 'experienc':361B 'famili':447B 'field':81B 'forc':15B 'forest':75B 'formal':405B 'former':4B 'four':394B 'galleri':440B 'game':349B,417B,498B 'gamer':362B 'gather':305B,318B 'given':144B 'gone':382B 'hand':168B 'held':326B 'hex':175B,265B 'hexagon':95B 'hill':72B 'histori':352B 'hobbi':370B 'honeycomb':106B 'hotel':223B 'hous':148B,181B,218B 'improv':238B 'includ':91B 'intersect':158B 'island':18B,38B 'japan':477B 'kosmo':379B 'land':59B 'larg':94B 'largest':296B 'last':179B 'last-plac':178B 'licens':388B 'longest':292B 'made':495B 'may':324B 'mayfair':390B 'mountain':78B 'move':259B 'multipl':340B,384B 'new':264B,367B,474B 'number':121B 'numer':486B 'off':489B 'one':344B 'ore':50B,80B 'origin':376B 'pastur':85B 'pawn':187B 'perhap':207B 'place':93B,136B,156B,180B,189B 'play':199B 'player':9B,40B,142B,165B,250B,258B,273B,316B 'point':282B,313B,320B 'popular':348B 'port':118B,243B 'portabl':432B 'posit':216B 'possibl':198B,234B 'produc':39B,68B,73B,76B,79B,82B,86B 'publish':377B,427B 'random':92B 're':426B 're-publish':425B 'recent':351B 'renam':406B 'replac':442B 'repres':410B 'resourc':36B,44B,56B,71B,100B,139B,163B,170B,209B,231B,246B,269B 'road':26B,150B,293B 'robber':186B,261B 'rockman':484B 'roll':32B,128B,203B,214B,228B,255B 'secret':328B 'seri':421B 'set':89B 'set-up':88B 'settlement':23B,146B,287B 'settler':6B,398B,481B 'shape':107B 'sheep':45B,87B 'show':98B 'side':131B 'siedler':372B 'simpli':310B,464B 'special':439B 'specif':70B 'spend':43B 'spin':488B 'spin-off':487B 'steal':268B 'stick':151B 'structur':277B 'surround':109B 'theme':475B 'think':147B,222B 'tile':96B,113B,140B,164B,176B,193B,266B,281B 'total':332B 'trade':239B,245B 'travel':430B 'tri':10B 'turn':29B,155B,195B,229B 'two':129B,145B,429B 'type':60B 'undergon':393B 'unless':224B 'unproduct':66B 'upgrad':220B 'use':134B 'version':469B 'victori':312B 'von':373B 'water':112B 'well':364B 'wheat':46B,83B 'win':336B 'won':339B 'wood':47B,77B 'wooden':452B
325	Catan: Seafarers	This is an expansion for CATAN. Players can build shipping lanes, which are very similar to roads. Additionally, the game comes with many different water-hex-heavy variant setups. The English version (CATAN Studio) should only be used with the English base game, instead of the German one (Kosmos), because of matching components. The Kosmos German version should only be used with the German base game. Additionally, several different editions exist; 5th edition is the most recent. Editions should only be used with same edition, otherwise the purchase of adapter kit is required.&#10;&#10;Part of the Catan Series.&#10;&#10;This game requires CATAN.

822	Carcassonne	Carcassonne is a tile-placement game in which the players draw and place a tile with a piece of southern French landscape on it. The tile might feature a city, a road, a cloister, grassland or some combination thereof, and it must be placed adjacent to tiles that have already been played, in such a way that cities are connected to cities, roads to roads, etcetera. Having placed a tile, the player can then decide to place one of their meeples on one of the areas on it: on the city as a knight, on the road as a robber, on a cloister as a monk, or on the grass as a farmer. When that area is complete, that meeple scores points for its owner.&#10;&#10;During a game of Carcassonne, players are faced with decisions like: &quot;Is it really worth putting my last meeple there?&quot; or &quot;Should I use this tile to expand my city, or should I place it near my opponent instead, giving him a hard time to complete their project and score points?&quot; Since players place only one tile and have the option to place one meeple on it, turns proceed quickly even if it is a game full of options and possibilities.&#10;&#10;First game in the Carcassonne series.&#10;&#10;	2	5	30	45	7	\N	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/okM0dq_bEXnbyQTOvHfwRA__original/img/aVZEXAI-cUtuunNfPhjeHlS4fwQ=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic6544250.png	\N	\N	2000	'adjac':47B 'alreadi':52B 'area':88B,118B 'carcassonn':1A,2B,132B,213B 'citi':32B,60B,64B,93B,157B 'cloister':36B,105B 'combin':40B 'complet':120B,173B 'connect':62B 'decid':77B 'decis':137B 'draw':13B 'etcetera':68B 'even':198B 'expand':155B 'face':135B 'farmer':115B 'featur':30B 'first':209B 'french':23B 'full':204B 'game':8B,130B,203B,210B 'give':167B 'grass':112B 'grassland':37B 'hard':170B 'instead':166B 'knight':96B 'landscap':24B 'last':145B 'like':138B 'meepl':83B,122B,146B,192B 'might':29B 'monk':108B 'must':44B 'near':163B 'one':80B,85B,183B,191B 'oppon':165B 'option':188B,206B 'owner':127B 'piec':20B 'place':15B,46B,70B,79B,161B,181B,190B 'placement':7B 'play':54B 'player':12B,74B,133B,180B 'point':124B,178B 'possibl':208B 'proceed':196B 'project':175B 'put':143B 'quick':197B 'realli':141B 'road':34B,65B,67B,99B 'robber':102B 'score':123B,177B 'seri':214B 'sinc':179B 'southern':22B 'thereof':41B 'tile':6B,17B,28B,49B,72B,153B,184B 'tile-plac':5B 'time':171B 'turn':195B 'use':151B 'way':58B 'worth':142B

553	Chez Geek	In this light, humorous, and fast-paced card game that parodies geek culture and co-habitation, players are roommates just trying to get through life with as little work as possible.&#10;&#10;At setup each player is dealt a Job card which lists their free time, income, a special ability that they possess and their Slack goal. Players are also dealt five Life cards. The space directly in front of a player is their Room, where cards will be played during the course of the game. Slack can be represented using any available chit or counter, but every player begins with a Slack total of zero.&#10;&#10;Players take turns as follows:&#10;-Draw Life cards until they have six in hand. (NOTE: Some Jobs vary this to five or seven cards.)&#10;&#10;-Make &quot;variable&quot; rolls. Some Job cards have variable free time or income; their values for this turn are decided in this phase (rolling a 1-3 gives them   the first amount; rolling a 4-6 gives them the second). If there are any &quot;uninvited&quot; people in a player's room, he or she may also roll to &quot;get rid of&quot; them (by rolling a 4, 5 or 6) and either send each such person to another room or discard them (if they cannot be played to any other room).&#10;&#10;-If any of the player's in-hand Life cards are green Person cards, they may roll to &quot;call&quot; the person to their room. A successful roll (3-6) gets them invited in; otherwise, they are discarded. Some people are &quot;uninvited&quot; (causing bad things to happen), and may be placed without a roll in any player's room. (See above for &quot;getting rid of&quot; these people.) Pet cards, such as Cats (which don't require a roll to enter a room) and Dogs (which may or may not need to be &quot;called&quot;) can also be played in this round.&#10;&#10;-For each unit of free time the player's Job card gives them, they may perform one action (play a red Activity card) or go shopping (play any number of blue Thing cards). Some of these cards may have a cost; the total cost for all cards played in a round cannot exceed the income given to them by their Job card. (NOTE: Free Time and Income may be modified by certain Whenever cards played on the player by themselves or other players.)&#10;&#10;-At the end of a turn, if a player has more than five cards in hand, the player must discard cards until they have five or fewer. If desired, players can discard all the way down to one card. (NOTE: It is also legal for a player to play ALL the cards in their hand and have NO cards at the end of a turn.)&#10;&#10;-Additionally, some Life cards are orange &quot;Whenever&quot; cards which can be played at any time.&#10;&#10;-Activity cards and Thing cards typically list a Slack value which is added to the player's Slack total, though some have random Slack totals and some have Slack totals which vary during the game. TV Activity cards and some Whenever cards can be used to cancel cards as they are being played, and some cause previously-played cards to be discarded. Some cards add or subtract Slack from every player's total, while others cause a player to change their Job card (and hence Slack goal). Many cards alter the effects of other cards.&#10;&#10;The first player whose Slack total equals or exceeds their Slack goal is the winner.&#10;&#10;	2	5	60	60	13	\N	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/JhzwjB6QGY3RtuzlIeCAiQ__original/img/PJAgxjgfq34Ep4XpFoP-pdeiPSg=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic263890.jpg	\N	\N	1999	'-3':159B '-6':168B,252B '1':158B '3':251B '4':167B,198B '5':199B '6':201B 'abil':53B 'action':340B 'activ':344B,486B,522B 'ad':498B 'add':551B 'addit':471B 'also':63B,188B,317B,448B 'alter':576B 'amount':164B 'anoth':209B 'avail':96B 'bad':266B 'begin':103B 'blue':353B 'call':242B,315B 'cancel':532B 'cannot':216B,374B 'card':11B,44B,67B,80B,117B,133B,139B,233B,237B,291B,333B,345B,355B,359B,369B,384B,396B,419B,426B,444B,457B,464B,474B,478B,487B,490B,523B,527B,533B,545B,550B,569B,575B,581B 'cat':294B 'caus':265B,541B,562B 'certain':394B 'chang':566B 'chez':1A 'chit':97B 'co':19B 'co-habit':18B 'cost':363B,366B 'counter':99B 'cours':86B 'cultur':16B 'dealt':41B,64B 'decid':152B 'desir':434B 'direct':70B 'discard':212B,260B,425B,437B,548B 'dog':306B 'draw':115B 'effect':578B 'either':203B 'end':408B,467B 'enter':302B 'equal':588B 'everi':101B,556B 'exceed':375B,590B 'fast':9B 'fast-pac':8B 'fewer':432B 'first':163B,583B 'five':65B,130B,418B,430B 'follow':114B 'free':48B,142B,327B,386B 'front':72B 'game':12B,89B,520B 'geek':2A,15B 'get':27B,191B,253B,285B 'give':160B,169B,334B 'given':378B 'go':347B 'goal':60B,573B,593B 'green':235B 'habit':20B 'hand':123B,231B,421B,460B 'happen':269B 'henc':571B 'humor':6B 'in-hand':229B 'incom':50B,145B,377B,389B 'invit':255B 'job':43B,126B,138B,332B,383B,568B 'legal':449B 'life':29B,66B,116B,232B,473B 'light':5B 'list':46B,492B 'littl':32B 'make':134B 'mani':574B 'may':187B,239B,271B,308B,310B,337B,360B,390B 'modifi':392B 'must':424B 'need':312B 'note':124B,385B,445B 'number':351B 'one':339B,443B 'orang':476B 'other':561B 'otherwis':257B 'pace':10B 'parodi':14B 'peopl':178B,262B,289B 'perform':338B 'person':207B,236B,244B 'pet':290B 'phase':155B 'place':273B 'play':83B,218B,319B,341B,349B,370B,397B,454B,482B,538B,544B 'player':21B,39B,61B,75B,102B,110B,181B,227B,279B,330B,400B,405B,414B,423B,435B,452B,501B,557B,564B,584B 'possess':56B 'possibl':35B 'previous':543B 'previously-play':542B 'random':508B 'red':343B 'repres':93B 'requir':298B 'rid':192B,286B 'roll':136B,156B,165B,189B,196B,240B,250B,276B,300B 'room':78B,183B,210B,222B,247B,281B,304B 'roommat':23B 'round':322B,373B 'second':172B 'see':282B 'send':204B 'setup':37B 'seven':132B 'shop':348B 'six':121B 'slack':59B,90B,106B,494B,503B,509B,514B,554B,572B,586B,592B 'space':69B 'special':52B 'subtract':553B 'success':249B 'take':111B 'thing':267B,354B,489B 'though':505B 'time':49B,143B,328B,387B,485B 'total':107B,365B,504B,510B,515B,559B,587B 'tri':25B 'turn':112B,150B,411B,470B 'tv':521B 'typic':491B 'uninvit':177B,264B 'unit':325B 'use':94B,530B 'valu':147B,495B 'vari':127B,517B 'variabl':135B,141B 'way':440B 'whenev':395B,477B,526B 'whose':585B 'winner':596B 'without':274B 'work':33B 'zero':109B
16933	Super Munchkin	&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Publisher's DescriptionFly through the city. Smash the villains. Backstab your teammates and grab their gadgets.&#10;&#10;Munchkin has parodied the classic dungeon, the kung-fu warrior, the space epic, and the creatures of the night. Now, it's the superheroes' turn!&#10;&#10;Be a Mutant, an Exotic, a Mystic, or a Techno. The higher your Level, the more Powers you can have. Battle dastardly masterminds, devastating monsters, and invading aliens from the next dimension - from the wimpy Triplicate Twit all the way up to Big Ol' Planet Eater Guy himself - and TAKE THEIR STUFF! With the Aura Helmet, the Telezapinator, and the (jet-powered) Pogo Stick, no foe can stand before you.&#10;&#10;Super Munchkin is a stand-alone game, which (of course) can be combined with other Munchkin games. Designed by Steve Jackson (I) and illustrated by John Kovalic, this one is destined to RULE THE WORLD! Mwahahaha!&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;OtherPart of the Munchkin series&#10;&#10;Munchkin is a satirical card game based on the clich&eacute;s and oddities of Dungeons and Dragons and other role-playing games. Each player starts at level 1 and the winner is the first player to reach level 10. Players can acquire familiar D&amp;D style character classes during the game which determine to some extent the cards they can play.&#10;&#10;There are two types of cards - treasure and encounters. Each turn the current players 'kicks down the door' - drawing an encounter card from the deck. Usually this will involve battling a monster. Monsters have their own levels and players must try and overcome it using the levels, weapons and powers they have acquired during the game or run away. Other players can chose to help the player or hinder by adding extra monsters to the encounter. Defeating a monster will usually result in drawing treasure cards and acquiring levels. Being defeated by a monster results in &quot;bad stuff&quot; which usually involves losing levels and treasure.&#10;&#10;	3	6	90	90	10	\N	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/mczN7SxMfZqQWH75-s_fiQ__original/img/rjApHFxCQmcNGHP6JkYuBu1G9Mk=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic71945.jpg	\N	\N	2005	'1':186B '10':197B 'acquir':200B,272B,307B 'ad':290B 'alien':72B 'alon':122B 'aura':99B 'away':278B 'backstab':12B 'bad':316B 'base':164B 'battl':65B,249B 'big':87B 'card':162B,216B,225B,241B,305B 'charact':205B 'chose':282B 'citi':8B 'class':206B 'classic':23B 'clich':167B 'combin':129B 'cours':126B 'creatur':35B 'current':232B 'd':202B,203B 'dastard':66B 'deck':244B 'defeat':296B,310B 'descriptionfli':5B 'design':134B 'destin':147B 'determin':211B 'devast':68B 'dimens':76B 'door':237B 'dragon':174B 'draw':238B,303B 'dungeon':24B,172B 'eater':90B 'encount':228B,240B,295B 'epic':32B 'exot':49B 'extent':214B 'extra':291B 'familiar':201B 'first':192B 'foe':111B 'fu':28B 'gadget':18B 'game':123B,133B,163B,180B,209B,275B 'grab':16B 'guy':91B 'helmet':100B 'help':284B 'higher':56B 'hinder':288B 'illustr':140B 'invad':71B 'involv':248B,320B 'jackson':137B 'jet':106B 'jet-pow':105B 'john':142B 'kick':234B 'koval':143B 'kung':27B 'kung-fu':26B 'level':58B,185B,196B,256B,266B,308B,322B 'lose':321B 'mastermind':67B 'monster':69B,251B,252B,292B,298B,313B 'munchkin':2A,19B,117B,132B,156B,158B 'must':259B 'mutant':47B 'mwahahaha':152B 'mystic':51B 'next':75B 'night':38B 'odditi':170B 'ol':88B 'one':145B 'otherpart':153B 'overcom':262B 'parodi':21B 'planet':89B 'play':179B,219B 'player':182B,193B,198B,233B,258B,280B,286B 'pogo':108B 'power':61B,107B,269B 'publish':3B 'reach':195B 'result':301B,314B 'role':178B 'role-play':177B 'rule':149B 'run':277B 'satir':161B 'seri':157B 'smash':9B 'space':31B 'stand':113B,121B 'stand-alon':120B 'start':183B 'steve':136B 'stick':109B 'stuff':96B,317B 'style':204B 'super':1A,116B 'superhero':43B 'take':94B 'teammat':14B 'techno':54B 'telezapin':102B 'treasur':226B,304B,324B 'tri':260B 'triplic':80B 'turn':44B,230B 'twit':81B 'two':222B 'type':223B 'use':264B 'usual':245B,300B,319B 'villain':11B 'warrior':29B 'way':84B 'weapon':267B 'wimpi':79B 'winner':189B 'world':151B

Grab the treasure and run.&#10;&#10;Admit it. You love it.&#10;&#10;This award-winning card game, designed by Steve Jackson, captures the essence of the dungeon experience... with none of that stupid roleplaying stuff. You and your friends compete to kill monsters and grab magic items. And what magic items! Don the Horny Helmet and the Boots of Butt-Kicking. Wield the Staff of Napalm... or maybe the Chainsaw of Bloody Dismemberment. Start by slaughtering the Potted Plant and the Drooling Slime, and work your way up to the Plutonium Dragon...&#10;&#10;And it's illustrated by John Kovalic! Fast-playing and silly, Munchkin can reduce any roleplaying group to hysteria.

25071	Munchkin Cthulhu	Munchkins have hacked their way through dungeons, kung fu temples, starships, haunted houses, and super-foes. Now they face their greatest challenge &ndash; Cthulhu!

Will they...level up?&#10;&#10;Munchkin Cthulhu is a standalone game in the Munchkin universe, this time lampooning Lovecraft's Mythos and the horror gaming that surrounds it. This base game features four new Classes, including the Cultist, and a lot of classic monsters from outside reality &ndash; and they all have Stuff you can take from their twitching bodies. You can play Munchkin Cthulhu by itself, or combine it with any number of other Munchkin titles for mind-bending silliness.&#10;&#10;Part of the Munchkin series.&#10;&#10;Munchkin is a satirical card game based on the clich&eacute;s and oddities of Dungeons and Dragons and other role-playing games. Each player starts at level 1 and the winner is the first player to reach level 10. Players can acquire familiar D&amp;D style character classes during the game which determine to some extent the cards they can play.&#10;&#10;There are two types of cards - treasure and encounters. Each turn the current players 'kicks down the door' - drawing an encounter card from the deck. Usually this will involve battling a monster. Monsters have their own levels and players must try and overcome it using the levels, weapons and powers they have acquired during the game or run away. Other players can chose to help the player or hinder by adding extra monsters to the encounter. Defeating a monster will usually result in drawing treasure cards and acquiring levels. Being defeated by a monster results in &quot;bad stuff&quot; which usually involves losing levels and treasure.&#10;&#10;	3	6	90	90	10	\N	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/xFlGGfyoP4Pb-nYKxJTi7A__original/img/Wpa4WcLLng6qxx5zysK7ieQVGNk=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic162995.jpg	\N	\N	2007	'1':148B '10':159B 'acquir':162B,234B,269B 'ad':252B 'away':240B 'bad':278B 'base':63B,126B 'battl':211B 'bend':113B 'bodi':92B 'card':124B,178B,187B,203B,267B 'challeng':25B 'charact':167B 'chose':244B 'class':68B,168B 'classic':76B 'clich':129B 'combin':101B 'cthulhu':2A,26B,40B,97B 'cultist':71B 'current':194B 'd':164B,165B 'deck':206B 'defeat':258B,272B 'determin':173B 'door':199B 'dragon':136B 'draw':200B,265B 'dungeon':9B,134B 'encount':190B,202B,257B 'extent':176B 'extra':253B 'face':22B 'familiar':163B 'featur':65B 'first':154B 'foe':19B 'four':66B 'fu':11B 'game':44B,58B,64B,125B,142B,171B,237B 'greatest':24B 'hack':5B 'haunt':14B 'help':246B 'hinder':250B 'horror':57B 'hous':15B 'includ':69B 'involv':210B,282B 'kick':196B 'kung':10B 'lampoon':51B 'level':37B,147B,158B,218B,228B,270B,284B 'lose':283B 'lot':74B 'lovecraft':52B 'mind':112B 'mind-bend':111B 'monster':77B,213B,214B,254B,260B,275B 'munchkin':1A,3B,39B,47B,96B,108B,118B,120B 'must':221B 'mytho':54B 'new':67B 'number':105B 'odditi':132B 'outsid':79B 'overcom':224B 'part':115B 'play':95B,141B,181B 'player':144B,155B,160B,195B,220B,242B,248B 'power':231B 'reach':157B 'realiti':80B 'result':263B,276B 'retain':32B 'role':140B 'role-play':139B 'run':239B 'saniti':34B 'satir':123B 'seri':119B 'silli':114B 'standalon':43B 'starship':13B 'start':145B 'stuff':85B,279B 'style':166B 'super':18B 'super-fo':17B 'surround':60B 'surviv':29B 'take':88B 'templ':12B 'time':50B 'titl':109B 'treasur':188B,266B,286B 'tri':222B 'turn':192B 'twitch':91B 'two':184B 'type':185B 'univers':48B 'use':226B 'usual':207B,262B,281B 'way':7B 'weapon':229B 'winner':151B
70323	King of Tokyo	In King of Tokyo, you play mutant monsters, gigantic robots, and strange aliens&mdash;all of whom are destroying Tokyo and whacking each other in order to become the one and only King of Tokyo.&#10;&#10;At the start of each turn, you roll six dice, which show the following six symbols: 1, 2, or 3 Victory Points, Energy, Heal, and Attack. Over three successive throws, choose whether to keep or discard each die in order to win victory points, gain energy, restore health, or attack other players into understanding that Tokyo is YOUR territory.&#10;&#10;The fiercest player will occupy Tokyo, and earn extra victory points, but that player can't heal and must face all the other monsters alone!&#10;&#10;Top this off with special cards purchased with energy that have a permanent or temporary effect, such as the growing of a second head which grants you an additional die, body armor, nova death ray, and more.... and it's one of the most explosive games of the year!&#10;&#10;In order to win the game, one must either destroy Tokyo by accumulating 20 victory points, or be the only surviving monster once the fighting has ended.&#10;&#10;First Game in the King of Tokyo series&#10;&#10;	2	6	30	30	8	\N	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/m_RzXpHURC0_xLkvRSR_sw__original/img/hSvWgiRYJCTTuoLOWTW3c8sYtl8=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3043734.jpg	\N	\N	2011	'1':54B '2':55B '20':184B '3':57B 'accumul':183B 'addit':150B 'alien':16B 'alon':121B 'armor':153B 'attack':63B,87B 'becom':30B 'bodi':152B 'card':127B 'choos':68B 'death':155B 'destroy':21B,180B 'dice':47B 'die':75B,151B 'discard':73B 'earn':104B 'effect':137B 'either':179B 'end':197B 'energi':60B,83B,130B 'explos':166B 'extra':105B 'face':116B 'fiercest':98B 'fight':195B 'first':198B 'follow':51B 'gain':82B 'game':167B,176B,199B 'gigant':12B 'grant':147B 'grow':141B 'head':145B 'heal':61B,113B 'health':85B 'keep':71B 'king':1A,5B,35B,202B 'monster':11B,120B,192B 'must':115B,178B 'mutant':10B 'nova':154B 'occupi':101B 'one':32B,162B,177B 'order':28B,77B,172B 'perman':134B 'play':9B 'player':89B,99B,110B 'point':59B,81B,107B,186B 'purchas':128B 'ray':156B 'restor':84B 'robot':13B 'roll':45B 'second':144B 'seri':205B 'show':49B 'six':46B,52B 'special':126B 'start':40B 'strang':15B 'success':66B 'surviv':191B 'symbol':53B 'temporari':136B 'territori':96B 'three':65B 'throw':67B 'tokyo':3A,7B,22B,37B,93B,102B,181B,204B 'top':122B 'turn':43B 'understand':91B 'victori':58B,80B,106B,185B 'whack':24B 'whether':69B 'win':79B,174B 'year':170B
240980	Blood on the Clocktower	In the quiet village of Ravenswood Bluff, &zwnj;a demon walks amongst you...&#10;&#10;During a hellish thunderstorm, on the stroke of midnight, there echoes a bone-chilling scream. The townsfolk rush to investigate and find the town storyteller murdered, their body impaled on the hands of the clocktower, blood dripping onto the cobblestones below. A Demon is on the loose, murdering by night and disguised in human form by day. Some have scraps of information. Others have abilities that fight the evil or protect the innocent. But the Demon and its evil minions are spreading lies to confuse and breed suspicion. Will the good townsfolk put the puzzle together in time to execute the true demon and save themselves? Or will evil overrun this once peaceful village?&#10;&#10;Blood on the Clocktower is a bluffing game enjoyed by 5 to 20 players on opposing teams of Good and Evil, overseen by a Storyteller player who conducts the action and makes crucial decisions. The goal of the game is to successfully deduce and execute the demons before they outnumber the townfolk.&#10;&#10;During a 'day' phase players socialize openly and whisper privately to trade knowledge or spread lies, culminating in a player's execution if a majority suspects them of being Evil. Of a 'night' time, players close their eyes and are woken one at a time by the Storyteller to gather information, spread mischief, or kill.&#10;&#10;The Storyteller uses the game's intricate playing pieces to guide each game, leaving others free to play without a table or board. Players stay in the thick of the action to the very end even if their characters are killed, haunting Ravenswood Bluff as ghosts trying to win from beyond the grave.&#10;&#10;If you arrive late to a game, you can enter after it's started as a powerful Traveller character with unusual talents and questionable allegiances. Each character comes with their own special ability and no two players in a game are ever the same character.&#10;&#10;	6	21	30	120	15	\N	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/HINb2nkFn5IiZxAlzQIs4g__original/img/e7izEwSmnBPiErsIF6hlWbgybBE=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic7009391.jpg	\N	\N	2022	'20':144B '5':142B 'abil':82B,324B 'action':161B,269B 'allegi':316B 'amongst':15B 'arriv':294B 'beyond':289B 'blood':1A,53B,132B 'bluf':138B 'bluff':11B,282B 'board':261B 'bodi':45B 'bone':30B 'bone-chil':29B 'breed':104B 'charact':277B,310B,318B,336B 'chill':31B 'clocktow':4A,52B,135B 'close':219B 'cobbleston':57B 'come':319B 'conduct':159B 'confus':102B 'crucial':164B 'culmin':200B 'day':74B,186B 'decis':165B 'deduc':174B 'demon':13B,60B,93B,120B,178B 'disguis':69B 'drip':54B 'echo':27B 'end':273B 'enjoy':140B 'enter':301B 'even':274B 'ever':333B 'evil':86B,96B,126B,152B,213B 'execut':117B,176B,205B 'eye':221B 'fight':84B 'find':39B 'form':72B 'free':254B 'game':139B,170B,243B,251B,298B,331B 'gather':233B 'ghost':284B 'goal':167B 'good':108B,150B 'grave':291B 'guid':249B 'hand':49B 'haunt':280B 'hellish':19B 'human':71B 'impal':46B 'inform':79B,234B 'innoc':90B 'intric':245B 'investig':37B 'kill':238B,279B 'knowledg':196B 'late':295B 'leav':252B 'lie':100B,199B 'loos':64B 'major':208B 'make':163B 'midnight':25B 'minion':97B 'mischief':236B 'murder':43B,65B 'night':67B,216B 'one':225B 'onto':55B 'open':190B 'oppos':147B 'other':80B,253B 'outnumb':181B 'overrun':127B 'overseen':153B 'peac':130B 'phase':187B 'piec':247B 'play':246B,256B 'player':145B,157B,188B,203B,218B,262B,328B 'power':308B 'privat':193B 'protect':88B 'put':110B 'puzzl':112B 'question':315B 'quiet':7B 'ravenswood':10B,281B 'rush':35B 'save':122B 'scrap':77B 'scream':32B 'social':189B 'special':323B 'spread':99B,198B,235B 'start':305B 'stay':263B 'storytel':42B,156B,231B,240B 'stroke':23B 'success':173B 'suspect':209B 'suspicion':105B 'tabl':259B 'talent':313B 'team':148B 'thick':266B 'thunderstorm':20B 'time':115B,217B,228B 'togeth':113B 'town':41B 'townfolk':183B 'townsfolk':34B,109B 'trade':195B 'travel':309B 'tri':285B 'true':119B 'two':327B 'unusu':312B 'use':241B 'villag':8B,131B 'walk':14B 'whisper':192B 'win':287B 'without':257B 'woken':224B
5457	Dread Pirate	Dread Pirate is an elegantly presented family game focusing on pirate lore and like any good Pirate the one with the most loot wins.&#10;&#10;Each of the pirates start in their own port with a few doubloons and jewels of their own color. The rest of that color of jewel are piled near their port and the remaining doubloons are piled on &ldquo;Dread Island&rdquo; in the center of the map, along with the &lsquo;fate&rsquo; cards that are drawn when sailing through specific marked areas of the board. It is these pirates goal to sail to the other ports and either raid or trade for jewels of the other colors. Once a pirate has at least one jewel of each color they can land on that Dread Island and collect some free doubloons. &quot;Skirmishes&quot;can be had with other pirates at sea and may slow the journey, but the reward of treasure can be great. Once all the jewels are gone from the original piles in the home ports (some will accumulate on Dread Island), the game is over and everyone counts the swag in their pouch.&#10;&#10;The 2002 Signature Edition of this game is packaged in a wooden treasure chest and includes a board in the form of an aged treasure map, three wooden dice, four treasure sacks, four die cast metal ships, one wooden wind cube, fifty-two Dread Pirate cards, four map cards, fifty replica doubloons, 120 treasure jewels, 1st Edition rulebook, and captain&rsquo;s log. The chest and rule book are also marked &quot;Old Century Classics&quot;.&#10;The 2003 Signature Edition is identical with the exception that it only has 100 jewels, and a 2nd Edition Rulebook and is marked &quot;Front Porch Classics&quot; instead of &quot;Old Century Classics&quot;.&#10;The 2007 Signature Edition differs from the 2003 version in that it has a 3rd Edition rulebook, a Jolly Roger flag, and the four map cards are discontinued.&#10;The cloth map has extra anchor icons identical to the ones seen in Buccaneer's Revenge, and the game comes in a black wooden chest instead of a brown one. It is also marked &quot;copyright Sababa Group&quot;, instead of Front Porch Classics.&#10;&#10;The Bookshelf Edition is packaged in a wooden bookshelf box and includes all of the components of the 2003 Signature Edition, plus a Jolly Roger flag. The rulebook is marked &quot;Bookshelf Edition&quot;. The Copyright 2003 Bookshelf edition rulebook is otherwise identical to the 2nd edition treasure chest rules.&#10; The 2007 Bookshelf Edition, which was marketed by Sababa Toys, has a rulebook that corresponds to the 2007 Signature Edition. It only has 45 gold pieces instead of the 50 seen in all previous editions. The coins are also smaller, and the cloth map is smaller than the one seen in the Signature Edition.&#10;Sababa Group editions of the game are also marked &quot;Copyright 2007 Sababa Group&quot; on the Dread Pirate cards and on the inside box lid.&#10;&#10;	2	4	60	60	8	\N	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/bAzuHajq10MLJrLVogs6yA__original/img/735sA_56Tw28sguiL2_B7CNERa0=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic726244.jpg	\N	\N	2002	'100':276B '120':242B '1st':245B '2002':190B '2003':264B,301B,382B,398B '2007':295B,413B,429B,476B '2nd':280B,407B '3rd':308B '45':435B '50':441B 'accumul':173B 'age':212B 'along':73B 'also':258B,354B,450B,473B 'anchor':327B 'area':86B 'black':344B 'board':89B,206B 'book':256B 'bookshelf':365B,372B,394B,399B,414B 'box':373B,488B 'brown':350B 'buccan':335B 'captain':249B 'card':77B,235B,238B,319B,483B 'cast':223B 'center':69B 'centuri':261B,292B 'chest':202B,253B,346B,410B 'classic':262B,288B,293B,363B 'cloth':323B,454B 'coin':448B 'collect':131B 'color':45B,50B,111B,122B 'come':341B 'compon':379B 'copyright':356B,397B,475B 'correspond':426B 'count':183B 'cube':229B 'dice':217B 'die':222B 'differ':298B 'discontinu':321B 'doubloon':39B,61B,134B,241B 'drawn':80B 'dread':1A,3B,65B,128B,175B,233B,481B 'edit':192B,246B,266B,281B,297B,309B,366B,384B,395B,400B,408B,415B,431B,446B,465B,468B 'either':102B 'eleg':7B 'everyon':182B 'except':271B 'extra':326B 'famili':9B 'fate':76B 'fifti':231B,239B 'fifty-two':230B 'flag':314B,389B 'focus':11B 'form':209B 'four':218B,221B,236B,317B 'free':133B 'front':286B,361B 'game':10B,178B,195B,340B,471B 'goal':94B 'gold':436B 'gone':162B 'good':18B 'great':156B 'group':358B,467B,478B 'home':169B 'icon':328B 'ident':268B,329B,404B 'includ':204B,375B 'insid':487B 'instead':289B,347B,359B,438B 'island':66B,129B,176B 'jewel':41B,52B,107B,119B,160B,244B,277B 'jolli':312B,387B 'journey':148B 'land':125B 'least':117B 'lid':489B 'like':16B 'log':251B 'loot':25B 'lore':14B 'map':72B,214B,237B,318B,324B,455B 'mark':85B,259B,285B,355B,393B,474B 'market':418B 'may':145B 'metal':224B 'near':55B 'old':260B,291B 'one':21B,118B,226B,332B,351B,460B 'origin':165B 'otherwis':403B 'packag':197B,368B 'piec':437B 'pile':54B,63B,166B 'pirat':2A,4B,13B,19B,30B,93B,114B,141B,234B,482B 'plus':385B 'porch':287B,362B 'port':35B,57B,100B,170B 'pouch':188B 'present':8B 'previous':445B 'raid':103B 'remain':60B 'replica':240B 'rest':47B 'reveng':337B 'reward':151B 'roger':313B,388B 'rule':255B,411B 'rulebook':247B,282B,310B,391B,401B,424B 'sababa':357B,420B,466B,477B 'sack':220B 'sail':82B,96B 'sea':143B 'seen':333B,442B,461B 'ship':225B 'signatur':191B,265B,296B,383B,430B,464B 'skirmish':135B 'slow':146B 'smaller':451B,457B 'specif':84B 'start':31B 'swag':185B 'three':215B 'toy':421B 'trade':105B 'treasur':153B,201B,213B,219B,243B,409B 'two':232B 'version':302B 'win':26B 'wind':228B 'wooden':200B,216B,227B,345B,371B
9220	Saboteur	Players take on the role of dwarves. As miners, they are in a mine, hunting for gold. Suddenly, a pick axe swings down and shatters the mine lamp. The saboteur has struck. But which of the players are saboteurs? Will you find the gold, or will the fiendish actions of the saboteurs lead them to it first? After three rounds, the player with the most gold is the winner.&#10;&#10;With the help of Dwarf Cards, the players are assigned their role: either miner or saboteur. The roles are kept secret- they are only revealed at the end of the round.&#10;&#10;The Start Card and the three Goal Cards are placed onto the table, each seven cards away from the start and one card between each Goal Card. The Goal Cards are placed face-down. The gold is on one of the Goal Cards, but nobody knows which.&#10;&#10;Players have cards in hand. On a player's turn, he must do one of three things: place a Path Card into the mine, play an Action Card in front of a player, or pass.&#10;&#10;The Path Cards form paths leading to the Goal Cards. Path Cards must be played next to a already-played Path Card. All paths on the Path Card must match those on the already-played cards, and Path Cards may not be played sideways.&#10;&#10;The miners are trying to build an uninterrupted path from the Start Card to a Goal Card, while the saboteurs are trying to prevent this. They shouldn't try and be too obvious about it, however, lest they be immediately discovered.&#10;&#10;Action Cards can be placed in front of any player, including oneself. Action Cards let the players help or hinder one another, as well as obtain information about the Goal Cards.&#10;&#10;Once a player places a Path Card that reaches the gold, the round is over. The miners have won and receive cards with gold pieces as their reward.&#10;&#10;The round is also over if the gold could not be reached. In that case, the saboteurs have won and receive the gold pieces.&#10;&#10;Once the Gold Cards have been distributed, the next round begins. The game is over at the end of the third round, with the player with the most gold pieces being the winner.&#10;&#10;	3	10	30	30	8	\N	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/0vJwP6NGa7GHPZKC3gplUw__original/img/TJDCd-PYySXmhQn-LC-y88JPA7U=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3989824.jpg	\N	\N	2004	'action':50B,176B,272B,284B 'alreadi':204B,220B 'already-play':203B,219B 'also':334B 'anoth':293B 'assign':80B 'away':118B 'axe':22B 'begin':365B 'build':236B 'card':76B,104B,109B,117B,124B,128B,131B,145B,152B,170B,177B,187B,194B,196B,207B,213B,222B,225B,243B,247B,273B,285B,302B,309B,324B,358B 'case':345B 'could':339B 'discov':271B 'distribut':361B 'dwarf':75B 'dwarv':8B 'either':83B 'end':98B,372B 'face':135B 'face-down':134B 'fiendish':49B 'find':43B 'first':58B 'form':188B 'front':179B,278B 'game':367B 'goal':108B,127B,130B,144B,193B,246B,301B 'gold':18B,45B,67B,138B,313B,326B,338B,353B,357B,383B 'hand':154B 'help':73B,289B 'hinder':291B 'howev':266B 'hunt':16B 'immedi':270B 'includ':282B 'inform':298B 'kept':90B 'know':148B 'lamp':29B 'lead':54B,190B 'lest':267B 'let':286B 'match':215B 'may':226B 'mine':15B,28B,173B 'miner':10B,84B,232B,319B 'must':161B,197B,214B 'next':200B,363B 'nobodi':147B 'obtain':297B 'obvious':263B 'one':123B,141B,163B,292B 'oneself':283B 'onto':112B 'pass':184B 'path':169B,186B,189B,195B,206B,209B,212B,224B,239B,308B 'pick':21B 'piec':327B,354B,384B 'place':111B,133B,167B,276B,306B 'play':174B,199B,205B,221B,229B 'player':2B,38B,63B,78B,150B,157B,182B,281B,288B,305B,379B 'prevent':254B 'reach':311B,342B 'receiv':323B,351B 'reveal':95B 'reward':330B 'role':6B,82B,88B 'round':61B,101B,315B,332B,364B,376B 'saboteur':1A,31B,40B,53B,86B,250B,347B 'secret':91B 'seven':116B 'shatter':26B 'shouldn':257B 'sideway':230B 'start':103B,121B,242B 'struck':33B 'sudden':19B 'swing':23B 'tabl':114B 'take':3B 'thing':166B 'third':375B 'three':60B,107B,165B 'tri':234B,252B,259B 'turn':159B 'uninterrupt':238B 'well':295B 'winner':70B,387B 'won':321B,349B
365702	Saboteur: The Dark Cave	After your dwarf clan found gold, you suddenly felt an earthquake and the mine is now collapsing. Time to escape! But the dark cave is full of dangers, such as spider webs, monsters, and of course the saboteurs who make your life miserable. Whose dwarf team can escape the cave with the most gold?&#10;&#10;Saboteur: The Dark Cave is a standalone game that recreates the feel of Saboteur. At the start of the game, each player assigned to a clan, although possibly they will be a saboteur for the other clan. Starting from the mine card in the center of play, you take turns laying down tunnel cards to build outward from the mine toward the four corner cards, only one of which is the exit. In addition to building new tunnels, you'll play cards to give yourself equipment, place monsters in front of others, discover who's actually on your clan, and reveal the exit before trudging all the way there. As soon as you leave the mine, you reveal your true identity, with any gold you have going toward your clan's total. As soon as all members of a clan have left, the game ends, and whichever clan has the most gold wins.&#10;&#10;	2	8	45	45	10	\N	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/VeDNaOVD1qcMDUDptcN0TA__original/img/hpQZiYMDZDvCDFEqLhQgXhVkZaA=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic6937730.jpg	\N	\N	2022	'actual':154B 'addit':132B 'although':85B 'assign':81B 'build':114B,134B 'card':100B,112B,123B,140B 'cave':4A,28B,54B,62B 'center':103B 'clan':8B,84B,95B,157B,188B,198B,206B 'collaps':21B 'corner':122B 'cours':40B 'danger':32B 'dark':3A,27B,61B 'discov':151B 'dwarf':7B,49B 'earthquak':15B 'end':203B 'equip':144B 'escap':24B,52B 'exit':130B,161B 'feel':70B 'felt':13B 'found':9B 'four':121B 'front':148B 'full':30B 'game':66B,78B,202B 'give':142B 'go':185B 'gold':10B,58B,182B,210B 'ident':179B 'lay':109B 'leav':172B 'left':200B 'life':46B 'll':138B 'make':44B 'member':195B 'mine':18B,99B,118B,174B 'miser':47B 'monster':37B,146B 'new':135B 'one':125B 'other':150B 'outward':115B 'place':145B 'play':105B,139B 'player':80B 'possibl':86B 'recreat':68B 'reveal':159B,176B 'saboteur':1A,42B,59B,72B,91B 'soon':169B,192B 'spider':35B 'standalon':65B 'start':75B,96B 'sudden':12B 'take':107B 'team':50B 'time':22B 'total':190B 'toward':119B,186B 'trudg':163B 'true':178B 'tunnel':111B,136B 'turn':108B 'way':166B 'web':36B 'whichev':205B 'whose':48B 'win':211B

19803	Martian Chess	Martian Chess is a 2-4 player game that uses Icehouse pieces, requiring one stash per player, and a chessboard. It was one of the games included in Icehouse: The Martian Chess Set and Pyramid Arcade.&#10;&#10;Much like its namesake, Martian Chess is a game of capturing pieces.  Like Chess, Martian Chess is turn based, and played on a chessboard.  In both games, players move and capture individual pieces, and each type of piece has distinct moving rules.&#10;&#10;However, Martian Chess differs from Chess in critical ways:&#10;&#10;     Piece ownership is determined not by color but by location.&#10;     Instead of capturing a specific piece, winning is determined by points, making it possible to force the end of the game and still win with no pieces left in that player's control.&#10;     Lastly, Martian Chess easily supports 4 players as well as two, and can also be played with 3, 5 or 6 players if you use geomorphic chessboard sections; see this photo for an example.&#10;&#10;&#10;	2	4	20	20	8	\N	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/1PBqpVSEirpqme8rnXuNGA__original/img/aChgTJCraDUMFLfUMkk5PUi9T9w=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic5241330.jpg	\N	\N	1995	'-4':8B '2':7B '3':150B '4':138B '5':151B '6':153B 'also':146B 'arcad':38B 'base':57B 'captur':49B,69B,102B 'chess':2A,4B,34B,44B,52B,54B,83B,86B,135B 'chessboard':22B,62B,159B 'color':96B 'control':132B 'critic':88B 'determin':93B,108B 'differ':84B 'distinct':78B 'easili':136B 'end':117B 'exampl':166B 'forc':115B 'game':10B,28B,47B,65B,120B 'geomorph':158B 'howev':81B 'icehous':13B,31B 'includ':29B 'individu':70B 'instead':100B 'last':133B 'left':127B 'like':40B,51B 'locat':99B 'make':111B 'martian':1A,3B,33B,43B,53B,82B,134B 'move':67B,79B 'much':39B 'namesak':42B 'one':16B,25B 'ownership':91B 'per':18B 'photo':163B 'piec':14B,50B,71B,76B,90B,105B,126B 'play':59B,148B 'player':9B,19B,66B,130B,139B,154B 'point':110B 'possibl':113B 'pyramid':37B 'requir':15B 'rule':80B 'section':160B 'see':161B 'set':35B 'specif':104B 'stash':17B 'still':122B 'support':137B 'turn':56B 'two':143B 'type':74B 'use':12B,157B 'way':89B 'well':141B 'win':106B,123B

188834	Secret Hitler	Secret Hitler is a dramatic game of political intrigue and betrayal set in 1930s Germany. Each player is randomly and secretly assigned to be a liberal or a fascist, and one player is Secret Hitler. The fascists coordinate to sow distrust and install their cold-blooded leader; the liberals must find and stop the Secret Hitler before it's too late. The liberal team always has a majority.&#10;&#10;At the beginning of the game, players close their eyes, and the fascists reveal themselves to one another. Secret Hitler keeps his eyes closed, but puts his thumb up so the fascists can see who he is. The fascists learn who Hitler is, but Hitler doesn't know who his fellow fascists are, and the liberals don't know who anyone is.&#10;&#10;Each round, players elect a President and a Chancellor who will work together to enact a law from a random deck. If the government passes a fascist law, players must try to figure out if they were betrayed or simply unlucky. Secret Hitler also features government powers that come into play as fascism advances. The fascists will use those powers to create chaos unless liberals can pull the nation back from the brink of war.&#10;&#10;The objective of the liberal team is to pass five liberal policies or assassinate Secret Hitler. The objective of the fascist team is to pass six fascist policies or elect Secret Hitler chancellor after three fascist policies have passed.&#10;&#10;	5	10	45	45	13	\N	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/rAQ3hIXoH6xDcj41v9iqCg__original/img/7oKwNUYakx3-vHUBLHWVuFNKfl4=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic5164305.jpg	\N	\N	2016	'1930s':16B 'advanc':187B 'also':177B 'alway':68B 'anoth':89B 'anyon':132B 'assassin':222B 'assign':24B 'back':203B 'begin':74B 'betray':13B,171B 'blood':49B 'brink':206B 'chancellor':142B,241B 'chao':196B 'close':79B,95B 'cold':48B 'cold-blood':47B 'come':182B 'coordin':40B 'creat':195B 'deck':154B 'distrust':43B 'doesn':117B 'dramat':7B 'elect':137B,238B 'enact':148B 'eye':81B,94B 'fascism':186B 'fascist':31B,39B,84B,103B,110B,123B,160B,189B,229B,235B,244B 'featur':178B 'fellow':122B 'figur':166B 'find':54B 'five':218B 'game':8B,77B 'germani':17B 'govern':157B,179B 'hitler':2A,4B,37B,59B,91B,113B,116B,176B,224B,240B 'instal':45B 'intrigu':11B 'keep':92B 'know':119B,130B 'late':64B 'law':150B,161B 'leader':50B 'learn':111B 'liber':28B,52B,66B,127B,198B,213B,219B 'major':71B 'must':53B,163B 'nation':202B 'object':210B,226B 'one':33B,88B 'pass':158B,217B,233B,247B 'play':184B 'player':19B,34B,78B,136B,162B 'polici':220B,236B,245B 'polit':10B 'power':180B,193B 'presid':139B 'pull':200B 'put':97B 'random':21B,153B 'reveal':85B 'round':135B 'secret':1A,3B,23B,36B,58B,90B,175B,223B,239B 'see':105B 'set':14B 'simpli':173B 'six':234B 'sow':42B 'stop':56B 'team':67B,214B,230B 'three':243B 'thumb':99B 'togeth':146B 'tri':164B 'unless':197B 'unlucki':174B 'use':191B 'war':208B 'work':145B

377708	Fruits	Fruits is no ordinary card game. This juicy twist on fast-paced favorites like Uno and Gin Rummy is chock-full of cheerful claymation art and surprising disruptors to keep you on your toes.&#10;&#10;Players will encounter ten types of personality-packed Fruits cards of varying point values and must harvest &ldquo;bunches&rdquo; of three or more fruits to earn points. Along the way, action cards will come into play, either multiplying players&rsquo; successes or thwarting their efforts to gather the most fruit; for example: a pie card can double the total value of a bunch, but a grabber card gives an opponent the chance to steal a card&mdash;and all of its potential points&mdash;from another player&rsquo;s hand.&#10;&#10;Gameplay continues until one lucky fruit collector accumulates a thousand points and wins the game! Hope you&rsquo;ve been eating your fruits, because Fruits requires a dash of luck, a little strategy, and a whole lot of zest.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;	2	5	20	40	5	\N	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/degxxo3nBftgGtIiiVt9Og__original/img/J_186Qb5-O1G9OnOMzqXJKaQA8s=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic7871288.jpg	\N	\N	2022	'accumul':131B 'action':68B 'along':65B 'anoth':120B 'art':28B 'bunch':56B,99B 'card':6B,48B,69B,91B,103B,112B 'chanc':108B 'cheer':26B 'chock':23B 'chock-ful':22B 'claymat':27B 'collector':130B 'come':71B 'continu':125B 'dash':150B 'descript':162B 'disruptor':31B 'doubl':93B 'earn':63B 'eat':143B 'effort':81B 'either':74B 'encount':40B 'exampl':88B 'fast':13B 'fast-pac':12B 'favorit':15B 'fruit':1A,2B,47B,61B,86B,129B,145B,147B 'full':24B 'game':7B,138B 'gameplay':124B 'gather':83B 'gin':19B 'give':104B 'grabber':102B 'hand':123B 'harvest':55B 'hope':139B 'juici':9B 'keep':33B 'like':16B 'littl':154B 'lot':159B 'luck':152B 'lucki':128B 'multipli':75B 'must':54B 'one':127B 'oppon':106B 'ordinari':5B 'pace':14B 'pack':46B 'person':45B 'personality-pack':44B 'pie':90B 'play':73B 'player':38B,76B,121B 'point':51B,64B,118B,134B 'potenti':117B 'publish':165B 'requir':148B 'rummi':20B 'steal':110B 'strategi':155B 'success':77B 'surpris':30B 'ten':41B 'thousand':133B 'three':58B 'thwart':79B 'toe':37B 'total':95B 'twist':10B 'type':42B 'uno':17B 'valu':52B,96B 'vari':50B 've':141B 'way':67B 'whole':158B 'win':136B 'zest':161B
29387	Zombie Fluxx	Zombie Fluxx is the zombie uprising card game with ever-changing rules. There is now a new type of card: Ungoal cards (conditions in which everybody loses!)&#10;&#10;Fluxx is a card game where the cards themselves determine the current rules of the game. By playing cards, you change numerous aspects of the game: how to draw cards, how to play cards, and even how to win.&#10;&#10;At the start of the game, each player holds three cards and on a turn a player draws one card, then plays one card. By playing cards, you can put new rules into play that change numerous aspects of the game: how many cards to draw or play, how many cards you can hold in hand or keep on the table in front of you, and (most importantly) how to win the game.

95234	Cthulhu Gloom	From Dunwich to Innsmouth, from the halls of Miskatonic University to the Charles Dexter Ward at Arkham Asylum, trouble is in the air. The stars are almost right, and terrors from beyond space and time are beginning to break through. When Cthulhu rises, we're all doomed &ndash; but whose downfall will be the most entertaining?&#10;&#10;Cthulhu Gloom takes the game play of Atlas' Gloom and puts a Lovecraftian spin on it. Each player controls a group of protagonists, and your goal is to make them as miserable and insane as possible &ndash; preferably with them dying quickly while your opponents' heroes remain sane and (at a minimum) alive. In the publisher's description: &quot;While your characters Gibber With Ghouls and Learn Loathsome Lore to earn negative points, you'll encourage your opponents to be Analyzed by Alienists and to Just Forget About the Fungus to pile on positive points. When one group finally falls prey to the interdimensional doom that awaits us all, the player whose characters have suffered the most wins.&quot;&#10;&#10;As in Gloom, the cards in Cthulhu Gloom are transparent, allowing you to stack multiple modifier cards on a character card to alter its stats or undo what an opponent has done to you. While Cthulhu Gloom can be played on its own or combined with Gloom and its many expansions, it does introduce two new types of cards:&#10;&#10;&bull; Story cards can be in play from the start of the game, and the first player to meet a Story card's conditions &ndash; e.g., drawing the attention of The King in Yellow or heeding The Call of Cthulhu &ndash; claims the card and gains its benefits (or drawbacks).&#10;&#10;&bull; Transformation cards mutate a character for the remainder of the game, no matter which modifiers might come its way later. What's more, the character's image is replaced with &quot;something hideous and slimy&quot;. You'd expect no less really...&#10;&#10;	2	5	60	60	13	\N	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/0NIPJMlzch7WpotTjqGykw__original/img/HjxJsD6u9oZAAx3VNtf_Plv1Yqk=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1045316.jpg	\N	\N	2011	'air':25B 'alienist':138B 'aliv':109B 'allow':184B 'almost':29B 'alter':196B 'analyz':136B 'arkham':19B 'asylum':20B 'atlas':65B 'attent':259B 'await':162B 'begin':39B 'benefit':277B 'beyond':34B 'break':41B 'call':268B 'card':178B,190B,194B,232B,234B,253B,273B,281B 'charact':117B,168B,193B,284B,304B 'charl':15B 'claim':271B 'combin':218B 'come':296B 'condit':255B 'control':76B 'cthulhu':1A,44B,58B,180B,209B,270B 'd':315B 'descript':114B 'dexter':16B 'die':97B 'done':205B 'doom':49B,160B 'downfal':52B 'draw':257B 'drawback':279B 'dunwich':4B 'e.g':256B 'earn':126B 'encourag':131B 'entertain':57B 'expans':224B 'expect':316B 'fall':155B 'final':154B 'first':247B 'forget':142B 'fungus':145B 'gain':275B 'game':62B,244B,290B 'ghoul':120B 'gibber':118B 'gloom':2A,59B,66B,176B,181B,210B,220B 'goal':83B 'group':78B,153B 'hall':9B 'heed':266B 'hero':102B 'hideous':311B 'imag':306B 'innsmouth':6B 'insan':91B 'interdimension':159B 'introduc':227B 'king':262B 'later':299B 'learn':122B 'less':318B 'll':130B 'loathsom':123B 'lore':124B 'lovecraftian':70B 'make':86B 'mani':223B 'matter':292B 'meet':250B 'might':295B 'minimum':108B 'miser':89B 'miskaton':11B 'modifi':189B,294B 'multipl':188B 'mutat':282B 'negat':127B 'new':229B 'one':152B 'oppon':101B,133B,203B 'pile':147B 'play':63B,213B,238B 'player':75B,166B,248B 'point':128B,150B 'posit':149B 'possibl':93B 'prefer':94B 'prey':156B 'protagonist':80B 'publish':112B 'put':68B 'quick':98B 're':47B 'realli':319B 'remain':103B 'remaind':287B 'replac':308B 'right':30B 'rise':45B 'sane':104B 'slimi':313B 'someth':310B 'space':35B 'spin':71B 'stack':187B 'star':27B 'start':241B 'stat':198B 'stori':233B,252B 'suffer':170B 'take':60B 'terror':32B 'time':37B 'transform':280B 'transpar':183B 'troubl':21B 'two':228B 'type':230B 'undo':200B 'univers':12B 'us':163B 'ward':17B 'way':298B 'whose':51B,167B 'win':173B 'yellow':264B
128462	Cthulhu Gloom: Unpleasant Dreams	Game description from the publisher:&#10;&#10;In Cthulhu Gloom, you make your intrepid investigators face the most terrible terrors and madness before helping them pass on to their inevitable doom. Unpleasant Dreams brings the wonders and horrors of the Dreamlands to the table. Mix the 55 transparent cards in this set together with your copy of Cthulhu Gloom to add morbid new Modifiers, Events, Stories, Transformations, and Untimely Deaths, and a new family that calls the Dreamlands their home. Can you survive the creeping chaos of Nyarlathotep? Will your shantak be a loyal mount, or will you meet your end when you approach Azathoth? Dive into your own unpleasant dreams to find out!&#10;&#10;In addition to allowing for game play with up to six players, Unpleasant Dreams includes two new Character cards called Unwelcome Guests. Deal one or both face up to the table's center at the the start of the game. Guests &quot;follow&quot; the card types noted on them; no matter where it currently is, a living Guest immediately moves to join the family of the character on which one of its &quot;trigger&quot; cards is played. All its Modifiers are moved with it, and it's considered a member of that family until it moves again. This may delay the game's end if a final play draws a Guest to the near-winner's family!&#10;&#10;	2	6	0	0	0	\N	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Q9pjpgYBbeNbCfAmsu3eUA__original/img/EeP_nToQRLvisdUaVWeQJp8jC_c=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1379540.jpg	\N	\N	2012	'55':49B 'add':63B 'addit':118B 'allow':120B 'approach':106B 'azathoth':107B 'bring':36B 'call':78B,136B 'card':51B,135B,160B,189B 'center':149B 'chao':88B 'charact':134B,182B 'consid':202B 'copi':58B 'creep':87B 'cthulhu':1A,11B,60B 'current':169B 'deal':139B 'death':72B 'delay':214B 'descript':6B 'dive':108B 'doom':33B 'draw':223B 'dream':4A,35B,113B,130B 'dreamland':43B,80B 'end':103B,218B 'event':67B 'face':18B,143B 'famili':76B,179B,207B,232B 'final':221B 'find':115B 'follow':158B 'game':5B,122B,156B,216B 'gloom':2A,12B,61B 'guest':138B,157B,173B,225B 'help':26B 'home':82B 'horror':40B 'immedi':174B 'includ':131B 'inevit':32B 'intrepid':16B 'investig':17B 'join':177B 'live':172B 'loyal':96B 'mad':24B 'make':14B 'matter':166B 'may':213B 'meet':101B 'member':204B 'mix':47B 'modifi':66B,194B 'morbid':64B 'mount':97B 'move':175B,196B,210B 'near':229B 'near-winn':228B 'new':65B,75B,133B 'note':162B 'nyarlathotep':90B 'one':140B,185B 'pass':28B 'play':123B,191B,222B 'player':128B 'publish':9B 'set':54B 'shantak':93B 'six':127B 'start':153B 'stori':68B 'surviv':85B 'tabl':46B,147B 'terribl':21B 'terror':22B 'togeth':55B 'transform':69B 'transpar':50B 'trigger':188B 'two':132B 'type':161B 'unpleas':3A,34B,112B,129B 'untim':71B 'unwelcom':137B 'winner':230B 'wonder':38B

Instead of food, you have cards, and instead of pots and pans, you have your words and imagination. Three to seven players compete to emerge as the top chef at the table!&#10;&#10;Each round, one or more players are the judge, and the rest of the players are chefs. Every chef gathers ingredients from the Protein, Vegetable, and Flavor decks and, after the judge reveals the challenge, they choose which ones to get rid of and which ones to keep. Then, before the chefs can share their creation, the judge unveils the Secret Ingredient that must be incorporated in some way into each dish. After hearing what each chef has prepared, the judge will determine who wins each round. Then, the next player at the table becomes the judge - and at the end, the player with the most challenges won is the champion of Competition Kitchen.&#10;&#10;	3	8	20	60	0	\N	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/0I4LdJpVc_e6fQzBO3HZQA__original/img/nrPhwVPD7b_n_a91VBqXe6xcbo4=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3827263.jpg	\N	\N	2017	'becom':152B 'card':31B 'celebr':24B 'challeng':92B,164B 'champion':168B 'chef':22B,54B,74B,76B,109B,134B 'choos':94B 'compet':48B 'competit':1A,7B,170B 'cook':11B 'creation':113B 'deck':85B 'descript':3B 'determin':140B 'dish':129B 'emerg':50B 'end':158B 'everi':75B 'flavor':84B 'food':28B 'game':14B 'gather':77B 'get':17B,98B 'hear':131B 'imagin':43B 'incorpor':123B 'ingredi':78B,119B 'instead':26B,33B 'judg':25B,66B,89B,115B,138B,154B 'keep':105B 'kitchen':2A,8B,171B 'must':121B 'next':147B 'one':60B,96B,103B 'pan':37B 'parti':13B 'player':47B,63B,72B,148B,160B 'pot':35B 'prepar':136B 'protein':81B 'publish':6B 'rest':69B 'reveal':90B 'rid':99B 'rockstar':21B 'round':59B,144B 'secret':118B 'seven':46B 'share':111B 'show':12B 'tabl':57B,151B 'three':44B 'top':53B 'unveil':116B 'veget':82B 'way':126B 'win':142B 'won':165B 'word':41B
131835	Boss Monster: The Dungeon Building Card Game	Inspired by a love of classic video games, Boss Monster: The Dungeon Building Card Game pits 2-4 players in a competition to build the ultimate side-scrolling dungeon. Players compete to lure and destroy hapless adventurers, racing to outbid one another to see who can build the most enticing, treasure-filled dungeon. The goal of Boss Monster is to be the first Boss to amass ten Souls, which are gained when a Hero is lured and defeated &mdash; but a player can lose if his Boss takes five Wounds from Heroes who survive his dungeon.&#10;&#10;Playing Boss Monster requires you to juggle two competing priorities: the need to lure Heroes at a faster rate than your opponents, and the need to kill those Heroes before they reach your Boss. Players can build one room per turn, each with its own damage and treasure value. More attractive rooms tend to deal less damage, so a Boss who is too greedy can become inundated with deadly Heroes.&#10;&#10;Players interact with each other by building rooms and playing Spells. Because different Heroes seek different treasure types, and rooms are built simultaneously (played face down, then revealed), this means that every &quot;build phase&quot; is a bidding war. Spells are instant-speed effects that can give players advantages or disrupt opponents.&#10;&#10;As a standalone card game with 155 cards, Boss Monster contains everything that 2-4 players need to play.&#10;&#10;	2	4	30	30	13	\N	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/VBwaHyx-NWL3VLcCWKRA0w__original/img/izAmJ81QELl5DoK3y2bzJw55lhA=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1732644.jpg	\N	\N	2013	'-4':25B,241B '155':233B '2':24B,240B 'advantag':223B 'adventur':45B 'amass':75B 'anoth':50B 'attract':155B 'becom':170B 'bid':211B 'boss':1A,16B,66B,73B,95B,106B,138B,164B,235B 'build':5A,20B,31B,55B,141B,181B,207B 'built':196B 'card':6A,21B,230B,234B 'classic':13B 'compet':39B,113B 'competit':29B 'contain':237B 'damag':150B,161B 'dead':173B 'deal':159B 'defeat':87B 'destroy':43B 'differ':187B,190B 'disrupt':225B 'dungeon':4A,19B,37B,62B,104B 'effect':218B 'entic':58B 'everi':206B 'everyth':238B 'face':199B 'faster':122B 'fill':61B 'first':72B 'five':97B 'gain':80B 'game':7A,15B,22B,231B 'give':221B 'goal':64B 'greedi':168B 'hapless':44B 'hero':83B,100B,119B,133B,174B,188B 'inspir':8B 'instant':216B 'instant-spe':215B 'interact':176B 'inund':171B 'juggl':111B 'kill':131B 'less':160B 'lose':92B 'love':11B 'lure':41B,85B,118B 'mean':204B 'monster':2A,17B,67B,107B,236B 'need':116B,129B,243B 'one':49B,142B 'oppon':126B,226B 'outbid':48B 'per':144B 'phase':208B 'pit':23B 'play':105B,184B,198B,245B 'player':26B,38B,90B,139B,175B,222B,242B 'prioriti':114B 'race':46B 'rate':123B 'reach':136B 'requir':108B 'reveal':202B 'room':143B,156B,182B,194B 'scroll':36B 'see':52B 'seek':189B 'side':35B 'side-scrol':34B 'simultan':197B 'soul':77B 'speed':217B 'spell':185B,213B 'standalon':229B 'surviv':102B 'take':96B 'ten':76B 'tend':157B 'treasur':60B,152B,191B 'treasure-fil':59B 'turn':145B 'two':112B 'type':192B 'ultim':33B 'valu':153B 'video':14B 'war':212B 'wound':98B
184491	Spaceteam	Spaceteam is a fast-paced, cooperative shouting card game in which you race to repair your malfunctioning spaceship.&#10;&#10;Your goal is to ensure that all ship systems are functioning properly before time runs out. Each player must deal with the various malfunctions in their sector by flipping cards from the malfunction deck in front of them, and fixing the ship's systems. You'll have an arsenal of disorganized space tools spread among all players' hands, but finding the right tools can be harder than you think, especially when your Spaceteam is franticly worrying about malfunctions in their own sector. If that wasn&rsquo;t hard enough, you&rsquo;ll also have to deal with complications such as wormholes and asteroid fields, which require the coordination of the entire Spaceteam. There are no turns; everyone plays and shouts at the same time. Victory is achieved if enough malfunctions are corrected to reveal the 6 hidden System-Go Cards before time is up.&#10;&#10;	3	6	5	5	10	\N	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/eRLam_QqrGZIQbmhB3GWIA__original/img/cQ8j6i9xrhacZIkPoNHgL3wfRTw=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic2722498.png	\N	\N	2015	'6':154B 'achiev':145B 'also':111B 'among':75B 'arsenal':69B 'asteroid':121B 'card':10B,50B,159B 'complic':116B 'cooper':8B 'coordin':126B 'correct':150B 'deal':40B,114B 'deck':54B 'disorgan':71B 'enough':108B,147B 'ensur':25B 'entir':129B 'especi':90B 'everyon':135B 'fast':6B 'fast-pac':5B 'field':122B 'find':80B 'fix':60B 'flip':49B 'frantic':95B 'front':56B 'function':31B 'game':11B 'go':158B 'goal':22B 'hand':78B 'hard':107B 'harder':86B 'hidden':155B 'll':66B,110B 'malfunct':19B,44B,53B,98B,148B 'must':39B 'pace':7B 'play':136B 'player':38B,77B 'proper':32B 'race':15B 'repair':17B 'requir':124B 'reveal':152B 'right':82B 'run':35B 'sector':47B,102B 'ship':28B,62B 'shout':9B,138B 'space':72B 'spaceship':20B 'spaceteam':1A,2B,93B,130B 'spread':74B 'system':29B,64B,157B 'system-go':156B 'think':89B 'time':34B,142B,161B 'tool':73B,83B 'turn':134B 'various':43B 'victori':143B 'wasn':105B 'wormhol':119B 'worri':96B

11	Bohnanza	Bohnanza is the first in the Bohnanza family of games and has been published in several different editions, including a 2023 version with flowers.&#10;&#10;In the game, you plant, then harvest bean cards in order to earn coins. Each player starts with a hand of random bean cards, and each card has a number on it corresponding to the number of that type of beans in the deck. Unlike in most other card games, you can't rearrange the order of cards in hand, so you must use them in the order that you've picked them up from the deck &mdash; unless you can trade them to other players, which is the heart of the game.&#10;&#10;On a turn, you must plant the first one or two cards in your hand into the &quot;fields&quot; in front of you. Each field can hold only one type of bean, so if you must plant a type of bean that's not in one of your fields, then you must harvest a field to make room for the new arrival. This usually isn't good! Next, you reveal two cards from the deck, and you can then trade these cards as well as any card in your hand for cards from other players. You can even make future promises for cards received right now! After all the trading is complete &mdash; and all trades on a turn must involve the active player &mdash; then you end your turn by drawing cards from the deck and placing them at the back of your hand.&#10;&#10;When you harvest beans, you receive coins based on the number of bean cards in that field and the &quot;beanometer&quot; for that particular type of bean. Flip over 1-4 cards from that field to transform them into coins, then place the remainder of the cards in the discard pile. When the deck runs out, shuffle the discards, playing through the deck two more times. At the end of the game, everyone can harvest their fields, then whoever has earned the most coins wins.&#10;&#10;The original German edition supports 3-5 players. The English version from Rio Grande Games comes with the first edition of the first German expansion included in a slightly oversized box. One difference in the contents, however, is that bean #22's Weinbrandbohne (Brandy Bean) was replaced by the Wachsbohne, or Wax Bean. This edition includes rules for up to seven players, like the Erweiterungs-Set, but also adapts the two-player rules of Al Cabohne in order to allow two people to play Bohnanza.&#10;&#10;	2	7	45	45	12	\N	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/8SADtu_4zBH_UJrCo935Iw__original/img/RNuAr2CDbxE3XzeJVkxj4Df3eVM=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic6348964.jpg	\N	\N	1997	'-4':289B '-5':350B '1':288B '2023':22B '22':384B '3':349B 'activ':238B 'adapt':413B 'al':420B 'allow':425B 'also':412B 'arriv':178B 'back':256B 'base':267B 'bean':33B,48B,66B,148B,157B,263B,272B,285B,383B,388B,396B 'beanomet':279B 'bohnanza':1A,2B,8B,430B 'box':374B 'brandi':387B 'cabohn':421B 'card':34B,49B,52B,74B,83B,129B,188B,198B,203B,208B,219B,247B,273B,290B,305B 'coin':39B,266B,298B,342B 'come':359B 'complet':228B 'content':379B 'correspond':58B 'deck':69B,102B,191B,250B,312B,321B 'differ':18B,376B 'discard':308B,317B 'draw':246B 'earn':38B,339B 'edit':19B,347B,363B,398B 'end':242B,327B 'english':353B 'erweiterung':409B 'erweiterungs-set':408B 'even':214B 'everyon':331B 'expans':368B 'famili':9B 'field':135B,141B,165B,171B,276B,293B,335B 'first':5B,125B,362B,366B 'flip':286B 'flower':25B 'front':137B 'futur':216B 'game':11B,28B,75B,117B,330B,358B 'german':346B,367B 'good':183B 'grand':357B 'hand':45B,85B,132B,206B,259B 'harvest':32B,169B,262B,333B 'heart':114B 'hold':143B 'howev':380B 'includ':20B,369B,399B 'involv':236B 'isn':181B 'like':406B 'make':173B,215B 'must':88B,122B,152B,168B,235B 'new':177B 'next':184B 'number':55B,61B,270B 'one':126B,145B,162B,375B 'order':36B,81B,93B,423B 'origin':345B 'overs':373B 'particular':282B 'peopl':427B 'pick':97B 'pile':309B 'place':252B,300B 'plant':30B,123B,153B 'play':318B,429B 'player':41B,110B,211B,239B,351B,405B,417B 'promis':217B 'publish':15B 'random':47B 'rearrang':79B 'receiv':220B,265B 'remaind':302B 'replac':390B 'reveal':186B 'right':221B 'rio':356B 'room':174B 'rule':400B,418B 'run':313B 'set':410B 'seven':404B 'sever':17B 'shuffl':315B 'slight':372B 'start':42B 'support':348B 'time':324B 'trade':106B,196B,226B,231B 'transform':295B 'turn':120B,234B,244B 'two':128B,187B,322B,416B,426B 'two-play':415B 'type':64B,146B,155B,283B 'unless':103B 'unlik':70B 'use':89B 'usual':180B 've':96B 'version':23B,354B 'wachsbohn':393B 'wax':395B 'weinbrandbohn':386B 'well':200B 'whoever':337B 'win':343B
351605	Bohnanza: 25th Anniversary Edition	In Bohnanza, you plant, then harvest bean cards in order to earn coins. Each player starts with a hand of random bean cards, and each card has a number on it corresponding to the number of that type of beans in the deck. Unlike in most other cards games, you can't rearrange the order of cards in hand, so you must use them in the order that you've picked them up from the deck &mdash; unless you can trade them to other players, which is the heart of the game.&#10;&#10;On a turn, you must plant the first one or two cards in your hand into the &quot;fields&quot; in front of you. Each field can hold only one type of bean, so if you must plant a type of bean that's not in one of your fields, then you must harvest a field to make room for the new arrival. This usually isn't good! Next, you reveal two cards from the deck, and you can then trade these cards as well as any card in your hand for cards from other players. You can even make future promises for cards received right now! After all the trading is complete &mdash; and all trades on a turn must involve the active player &mdash; then you end your turn by drawing cards from the deck and placing them at the back of your hand.&#10;&#10;When you harvest beans, you receive coins based on the number of bean cards in that field and the &quot;beanometer&quot; for that particular type of bean. Flip over 1-4 cards from that field to transform them into coins, then place the remainder of the cards in the discard pile. When the deck runs out, shuffle the discards, playing through the deck two more times. At the end of the game, everyone can harvest their fields, then whoever has earned the most coins wins.&#10;&#10;Bohnanza: 25 Jahre-Edition is a special 25th anniversary edition of the game that contains a new bean type (&quot;Elsterbohne&quot;; magpie bean) and comes with three variant games, one of which will use a collectible coin packaged in the box.&#10;&#10;	2	7	45	45	10	\N	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/kCHwr6TmMneB0UuMa68fRQ__original/img/GAusGSGqv4QLwd-tU7tfUoke9ao=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic6602522.jpg	\N	\N	2022	'-4':267B '1':266B '25':323B '25th':2A,330B 'activ':216B 'anniversari':3A,331B 'arriv':156B 'back':234B 'base':245B 'bean':11B,26B,44B,126B,135B,241B,250B,263B,340B,344B 'beanomet':257B 'bohnanza':1A,6B,322B 'box':362B 'card':12B,27B,30B,52B,61B,107B,166B,176B,181B,186B,197B,225B,251B,268B,283B 'coin':17B,244B,276B,320B,358B 'collect':357B 'come':346B 'complet':206B 'contain':337B 'correspond':36B 'deck':47B,80B,169B,228B,290B,299B 'discard':286B,295B 'draw':224B 'earn':16B,317B 'edit':4A,326B,332B 'elsterbohn':342B 'end':220B,305B 'even':192B 'everyon':309B 'field':113B,119B,143B,149B,254B,271B,313B 'first':103B 'flip':264B 'front':115B 'futur':194B 'game':53B,95B,308B,335B,350B 'good':161B 'hand':23B,63B,110B,184B,237B 'harvest':10B,147B,240B,311B 'heart':92B 'hold':121B 'involv':214B 'isn':159B 'jahr':325B 'jahre-edit':324B 'magpi':343B 'make':151B,193B 'must':66B,100B,130B,146B,213B 'new':155B,339B 'next':162B 'number':33B,39B,248B 'one':104B,123B,140B,351B 'order':14B,59B,71B 'packag':359B 'particular':260B 'pick':75B 'pile':287B 'place':230B,278B 'plant':8B,101B,131B 'play':296B 'player':19B,88B,189B,217B 'promis':195B 'random':25B 'rearrang':57B 'receiv':198B,243B 'remaind':280B 'reveal':164B 'right':199B 'room':152B 'run':291B 'shuffl':293B 'special':329B 'start':20B 'three':348B 'time':302B 'trade':84B,174B,204B,209B 'transform':273B 'turn':98B,212B,222B 'two':106B,165B,300B 'type':42B,124B,133B,261B,341B 'unless':81B 'unlik':48B 'use':67B,355B 'usual':158B 'variant':349B 've':74B 'well':178B 'whoever':315B 'win':321B
329082	Radlands	Radlands is a competitive, dueling card game about identifying fiercely powerful card synergies.&#10;&#10;Act as the leader of your post apocalyptic group of survivors in a tooth-and-nail fight to protect your three camps from a vicious rival tribe. If all of them are destroyed, you lose the game.&#10;&#10;The main resource in the game is water. You will spend it to play people and events, and to use the abilities of cards you already have on the table. People protect your camps and provide useful abilities, while events are powerful effects that take time to pay off.&#10;&#10;Both players draw cards from the same deck. All cards can either be played to the table or discarded for quick &ldquo;junk&rdquo; effects. To win, you will need to manage your cards and water wisely.&#10;&#10;	2	2	20	40	14	\N	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/YpQUtpxNtDHBF5eVcwzBtQ__original/img/br-kw0KuyBfH1mrxZ0kgVrF9UMc=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic6478338.png	\N	\N	2021	'abil':74B,90B 'act':15B 'alreadi':78B 'apocalypt':22B 'camp':37B,86B 'card':7B,13B,76B,105B,111B,133B 'competit':5B 'deck':109B 'destroy':48B 'discard':120B 'draw':104B 'duel':6B 'effect':95B,124B 'either':113B 'event':69B,92B 'fierc':11B 'fight':32B 'game':8B,52B,58B 'group':23B 'identifi':10B 'junk':123B 'leader':18B 'lose':50B 'main':54B 'manag':131B 'nail':31B 'need':129B 'pay':100B 'peopl':67B,83B 'play':66B,115B 'player':103B 'post':21B 'power':12B,94B 'protect':34B,84B 'provid':88B 'quick':122B 'radland':1A,2B 'resourc':55B 'rival':41B 'spend':63B 'survivor':25B 'synergi':14B 'tabl':82B,118B 'take':97B 'three':36B 'time':98B 'tooth':29B 'tooth-and-nail':28B 'tribe':42B 'use':72B,89B 'vicious':40B 'water':60B,135B 'win':126B 'wise':136B
699	HeroQuest	HeroQuest is Milton Bradley's approach to a Dungeons &amp; Dragons-style adventure game.  One player acts as game master, revealing the maze-like dungeon piecemeal as the players wander.  Up to four other players take on a character (wizard, elf, dwarf, or barbarian) and venture forth into dungeons on fantasy quests.  Plastic miniatures and 3-D furniture make this game very approachable.  Expansions were also released for this system.&#10;&#10;The HeroQuest series consists of the main game and a number of expansions.&#10;&#10;This game was made in cooperation with Games Workshop who designed the miniatures and helped in many of the production details including background world and art in the rule book and scenario book.&#10;&#10;Additional material which is generally missed since it is not technically an expansion was published in the HeroQuest: Adventure Design Kit which did feature one more Heroquest adventure: A Plague of Zombies.&#10;&#10;Other sources of HeroQuest

367079	HeroQuest: The Frozen Horror	The frozen horror has burst forth from the icy tomb where it rested these last centuries, recovering its strength and awaiting Zargon's summons. At last, that call has come, and the raging beast has returned to its ancient seat of power deep within the ice mountain. As we speak, it is rallying its minions and mobilizing its plans to cover the Northlands and the Realm in a shroud of deadly ice. Barbarian, you must call on courage and skill you did not realize you had to confront the evil of the frozen horror!&#10;&#10;In HeroQuest: The Frozen Horror, an expansion for the HeroQuest Game System, you must journey through the bleak and frigid Northlands to destroy the evil frozen horror, a ferocious creature long banished. As the powerful barbarian, you are first challenged to survive dangerous solo quests to prove your strength and valor. Only then will your fellow heroes join you to gain access to the ice mountain to destroy the Scepter of Glacial Majesty and defeat the terrible monster.&#10;&#10;	1	5	30	120	14	\N	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/KPMv_pQTlUSRoLfvqyCoWQ__original/img/8wR-O-ywVDByIf_xA8ixoIH4d4Q=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic6967838.png	\N	\N	2022	'access':160B 'ancient':43B 'await':25B 'banish':130B 'barbarian':77B,134B 'beast':38B 'bleak':116B 'burst':9B 'call':32B,80B 'centuri':20B 'challeng':138B 'come':34B 'confront':92B 'courag':82B 'cover':65B 'creatur':128B 'danger':141B 'dead':75B 'deep':47B 'defeat':173B 'destroy':121B,166B 'evil':94B,123B 'expans':105B 'fellow':154B 'feroci':127B 'first':137B 'forth':10B 'frigid':118B 'frozen':3A,6B,97B,102B,124B 'gain':159B 'game':109B 'glacial':170B 'hero':155B 'heroquest':1A,100B,108B 'horror':4A,7B,98B,103B,125B 'ice':50B,76B,163B 'ici':13B 'join':156B 'journey':113B 'last':19B,30B 'long':129B 'majesti':171B 'minion':59B 'mobil':61B 'monster':176B 'mountain':51B,164B 'must':79B,112B 'northland':67B,119B 'plan':63B 'power':46B,133B 'prove':145B 'quest':143B 'rage':37B 'ralli':57B 'realiz':88B 'realm':70B 'recov':21B 'rest':17B 'return':40B 'scepter':168B 'seat':44B 'shroud':73B 'skill':84B 'solo':142B 'speak':54B 'strength':23B,147B 'summon':28B 'surviv':140B 'system':110B 'terribl':175B 'tomb':14B 'valor':149B 'within':48B 'zargon':26B
1762	HeroQuest: Kellar's Keep	&ldquo;My friends, I have alarming news. The Emperor and his army are trapped in Kellar&rsquo;s Keep, the underground bastion of the fortress of Karak Varn. This great Dwarven stronghold lies deep within the heart of the World&rsquo;s Edge Mountains. The great book Loretome has revealed a secret passage to me that has been long forgotten. It will be your task to find this passage, known as Grin&rsquo;s Crag, and bring the Emperor to safety.&#10;&#10;The fortress is well defended, but I fear that time is against us. The Emperor&rsquo;s army weakens with starvation while the enemy grows stronger by the day. You must find the four pieces of Grin&rsquo;s map, that are scattered throughout the halls, if you are to locate the path to Kellar&rsquo;s Keep. You must not fail, for should you do so, our cause will be lost. It is up to you, brave Heroes, to rescue the Emperor.&rdquo;&#10;&#10;Contents.&#10;&#10;A new Quest Book containing 10 new adventures that must be played in sequence.&#10;&#10;17 finely detailed Citadel Miniatures featuring:&#10;- 8 Orcs&#10;- 6 Goblins&#10;- 3 Fimirs&#10;&#10;New full-colour game board overlays and punchouts including:&#10;- 2 Main Entrance/Exit folded doors&#10;- 1 Rolling Boulder token&#10;- 6 Spiral Passage steps tokens&#10;- 1 Dwarven Forge token&#10;- 4 Grin&rsquo;s Map puzzle piece tokens&#10;- 1 Magical Darkness token&#10;- 1 Grin&rsquo;s Crag precipice token&#10;- 2 Tunnel Trapdoor tokens&#10;- 2 Pit Trap tokens&#10;- 12 Fallen Rubble tokens&#10;&#10;	2	5	120	120	10	\N	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/D0SNccctDh4p89we8lA4SA__original/img/Q1Zdzrr7GzGskDsfqjNs898fuf8=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic57747.jpg	\N	\N	1991	'1':204B,213B,224B,228B '10':168B '12':242B '17':177B '2':199B,234B,238B '3':187B '4':217B '6':185B,208B '8':183B 'adventur':170B 'alarm':9B 'armi':15B,98B 'bastion':24B 'board':194B 'book':48B,166B 'boulder':206B 'brave':156B 'bring':77B 'caus':147B 'citadel':180B 'colour':192B 'contain':167B 'content':162B 'crag':75B,231B 'dark':226B 'day':109B 'deep':36B 'defend':86B 'detail':179B 'door':203B 'dwarven':33B,214B 'edg':44B 'emperor':12B,79B,96B,161B 'enemi':104B 'entrance/exit':201B 'fail':140B 'fallen':243B 'fear':89B 'featur':182B 'fimir':188B 'find':68B,112B 'fine':178B 'fold':202B 'forg':215B 'forgotten':61B 'fortress':27B,83B 'four':114B 'friend':6B 'full':191B 'full-colour':190B 'game':193B 'goblin':186B 'great':32B,47B 'grin':73B,117B,218B,229B 'grow':105B 'hall':125B 'heart':39B 'hero':157B 'heroquest':1A 'includ':198B 'karak':29B 'keep':4A,21B,136B 'kellar':2A,19B,134B 'known':71B 'lie':35B 'locat':130B 'long':60B 'loretom':49B 'lost':150B 'magic':225B 'main':200B 'map':119B,220B 'miniatur':181B 'mountain':45B 'must':111B,138B,172B 'new':164B,169B,189B 'news':10B 'orc':184B 'overlay':195B 'passag':54B,70B,210B 'path':132B 'piec':115B,222B 'pit':239B 'play':174B 'precipic':232B 'punchout':197B 'puzzl':221B 'quest':165B 'rescu':159B 'reveal':51B 'roll':205B 'rubbl':244B 'safeti':81B 'scatter':122B 'secret':53B 'sequenc':176B 'spiral':209B 'starvat':101B 'step':211B 'stronger':106B 'stronghold':34B 'task':66B 'throughout':123B 'time':91B 'token':207B,212B,216B,223B,227B,233B,237B,241B,245B 'trap':17B,240B 'trapdoor':236B 'tunnel':235B 'underground':23B 'us':94B 'varn':30B 'weaken':99B 'well':85B 'within':37B 'world':42B
